= Java Lombok

[role="_abstract"]
This section shows how to enable the Lombok support in your Java projects.

Project Lombok is a Java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your Java.
Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more.

By default `lombok.jar` is available in all Java plugins provided by {prod-short}

To enable Lombok in a {prod-short} workspace, use the instructions in this section.


.Prerequisites
A workspace or a devfile with

* One of the Java based plugin enabled (`redhat/java`, `redhat/java11`, `redhat/java8`, `redhat/quarkus-java8` or `redhat/quarkus-java11`),
* A valid Lombok project to import.

.Procedure

. Open the workspace devfile
. Edit the existing Java plugin section, adding the preference:

[source,json,attrs="nowrap"]
----
  - id: redhat/java/latest
    preferences:
      java.jdt.ls.vmargs: '-javaagent:/lombok.jar'
----


.Verification

. Start or restart the workspace.

. Open a file containing Lombok annotations.
