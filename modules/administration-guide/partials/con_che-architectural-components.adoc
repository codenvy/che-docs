= {prod-short} architectural components

As illustrated in the xref:high-level-che-architecture.adoc[] article, {prod} components are:

* A central workspace controller: an always running service that manages users workspaces
* Users workspaces: container-based IDEs that the controller stops when the user stops coding.

Both the {prod-short} central controller and user workspaces consist of a set of containers. Those containers contribute to the resources consumption in terms of CPU and RAM limits and requests. For a detailed explanation of how Kubernetes manages container-resource requests and limits, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/[Kubernetes documentation].
