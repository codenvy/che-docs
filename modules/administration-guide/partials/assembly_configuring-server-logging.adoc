:context: configuring-server-logging

It is possible to fine tune the log levels of individual loggers present in the {prod-short} server.
The log level of the {prod-short} server is usually configured globally, using the xref:installation-guide:configuring-the-che-installation.adoc#checluster-custom-resources-fields-reference_configuring-the-che-installation[`cheLogLevel` configuration property] of the operator.

However, if it is needed to change the log level selectively for some concrete logger, you can do that using the `CHE_LOGGER_CONFIG` 
environment variable.
