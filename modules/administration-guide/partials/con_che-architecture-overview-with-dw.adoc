= {prod-short} architecture when using the DevWorkspace Operator

{prod-short} default workspace engine is still the {prod-id-short}-server but from v.7.28.0 of {prod-short} an administrator can configure {prod-short} to use another workspace engine: the https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator[DevWorkspace {orch-name} Operator]. With this new workspace engine configured, {prod-short} workspaces are valid {orch-name} objects and inherit the characteristics of such objects: managed with the {orch-name} API and secured through RBAC. This section describes the architecture of {prod-short} with the DevWorkspace {orch-name} Operator as the workspace engine. This will eventually become the default architecture when the DevWorkspace will reach feature parity with {prod-id-short}-server. Until then an administrator has to explicitly configure {prod-id-short} to use the DevWorkspace following the instructions in xref:installation-guide:enabling-dev-workspace-engine.adoc[this article].

{prod} components, with the DevWorkspace Operator enabled, are:

* A workspace server: an always-running service that manages user workspaces through the DevWorkspace Operator.
* DevWorkspace Operator: the DevWorkspace Custom Resource Definition and the associated controller that extend {orch-name} and provide DevWorkpaces native support.
* User workspaces: container-based IDEs that the server stops when the user stops coding.

When {prod-short} is installed on a {platforms-name} cluster, the workspace server and the DevWorkspace Operator are deployed. A {prod-short} workspace is created immediately after a user requests it.
