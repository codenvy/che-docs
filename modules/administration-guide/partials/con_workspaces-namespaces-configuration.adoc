[id="workspace-namespaces-configuration_{context}"]
= Workspace {platforms-namespace} configuration

The {platforms-namespace} where a new workspace Pod is deployed depends on the {prod-short} server configuration. By default, every workspace is deployed in a distinct {platforms-namespace}, but the user can configure the {prod-short} server to deploy all workspaces in one specific {platforms-namespace}. The name of a {platforms-namespace} must be provided as a {prod-short} server configuration property and cannot be changed at runtime.
