The workspaces controller manages the container-based development environments: {prod-short} workspaces. It can be deployed in the following distinct configurations:

* *Single-user*: No authentication service is set up. Development environments are not secured. This configuration requires fewer resources. It is more adapted for local installations, such as when using Minikube.

* *Multi-user*: This is a multi-tenant configuration. Development environments are secured, and this configuration requires more resources. Appropriate for cloud installations.

The different services that are a part of the {prod-short} workspaces controller are shown in the following diagram. Note that {identity-provider} and PostgreSQL are only needed in the multi-user configuration.
