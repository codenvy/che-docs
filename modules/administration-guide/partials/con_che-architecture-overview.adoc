= {prod-short} architecture overview

{prod} components are:

* A central workspace controller: an always-running service that manages user workspaces through the {orch-name} API.
* User workspaces: container-based IDEs that the controller stops when the user stops coding.

When {prod-short} is installed on a {platforms-name} cluster, the workspace controller is the only component that is deployed. A {prod-short} workspace is created immediately after a user requests it.
