:=== 
 Property: Description 
airGapContainerRegistryHostname: Optional host name, or URL, to an alternate container registry to pull images from. This value overrides the container registry host name defined in all the default container images involved in a Che deployment. This is particularly useful to install Che in a restricted environment.
airGapContainerRegistryOrganization: Optional repository name of an alternate container registry to pull images from. This value overrides the container registry organization defined in all the default container images involved in a Che deployment. This is particularly useful to install {prod-short} in a restricted environment.
allowUserDefinedWorkspaceNamespaces: Defines that a user is allowed to specify Kubernetes namespace, or OpenShift project, different from the default. It's NOT RECOMMENDED to set to `true` without OpenShift OAuth configured. The OpenShift infrastructure also uses this property.
cheClusterRoles: A comma-separated list of ClusterRoles that will be assigned to Che ServiceAccount. Be aware that the che-operator has to already have all permissions in these ClusterRoles to grant them.
cheDebug: Enables the debug mode for Che server. Defaults to `false`.
cheFlavor: Specifies a variation of the installation. The options are `che` for upstream Che installations, or `codeready` for CodeReady Workspaces installation. If not necessary, do not override the default value.
cheHost: Public host name of the installed Che server. When value is omitted, the value it will be automatically set by the Operator. See the `cheHostTLSSecret` field.
cheHostTLSSecret: Name of a secret containing certificates to secure ingress or route for the custom host name of the installed Che server. See the `cheHost` field.
cheImage: Overrides the container image used in Che deployment. This does NOT include the container image tag. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.
cheImagePullPolicy: Overrides the image pull policy used in Che deployment. Default value is `Always` for `nightly` or `latest` images, and `IfNotPresent` in other cases.
cheImageTag: Overrides the tag of the container image used in Che deployment. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default image tag provided by the Operator.

cheServerRoute: The Che server route custom settings.
cheWorkspaceClusterRole: Custom cluster role bound to the user for the Che workspaces. The default roles are used if this is omitted or left blank.
customCheProperties: Map of additional environment variables that will be applied in the generated `che` configMap to be used by the Che server, in addition to the values already generated from other fields of the `CheCluster` custom resource (CR). When `customCheProperties` contains a property that would be normally generated in `che` configMap from other CR fields, the value defined in the `customCheProperties` is used instead.
devfileRegistryCpuLimit: Overrides the cpu limit used in the devfile registry deployment. In cores. (500m = .5 cores). Default to 500m.
devfileRegistryCpuRequest: Overrides the cpu request used in the devfile registry deployment. In cores. (500m = .5 cores). Default to 100m.

devfileRegistryUrl: Public URL of the devfile registry, that serves sample, ready-to-use devfiles. Set this ONLY when a use of an external devfile registry is needed. See the `externalDevfileRegistry` field. By default, this will be automatically calculated by the Operator.
externalDevfileRegistry: Instructs the Operator on whether or not to deploy a dedicated devfile registry server. By default, a dedicated devfile registry server is started. When `externalDevfileRegistry` is `true`, no such dedicated server will be started by the Operator and you will have to manually set the `devfileRegistryUrl` field
externalPluginRegistry: Instructs the Operator on whether or not to deploy a dedicated plugin registry server. By default, a dedicated plugin registry server is started. When `externalPluginRegistry` is `true`, no such dedicated server will be started by the Operator and you will have to manually set the `pluginRegistryUrl` field.
gitSelfSignedCert: When enabled, the certificate from `che-git-self-signed-cert` configMap will be propagated to the Che components and provide particular configuration for Git.
nonProxyHosts: List of hosts that will be reached directly, bypassing the proxy. Specify wild card domain use the following form `.<DOMAIN>` and `|` as delimiter, for example\: `localhost|.my.host.com|123.42.12.32` Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `nonProxyHosts` in a custom resource leads to merging non proxy hosts lists from the cluster proxy configuration and ones defined in the custom resources. (see the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html) (see also the `proxyURL` fields).

pluginRegistryMemoryLimit: Overrides the memory limit used in the plugin registry deployment. Defaults to 256Mi.
pluginRegistryMemoryRequest: Overrides the memory request used in the plugin registry deployment. Defaults to 16Mi.
pluginRegistryPullPolicy: Overrides the image pull policy used in the plugin registry deployment. Default value is `Always` for `nightly` or `latest` images, and `IfNotPresent` in other cases.
pluginRegistryRoute: Plugin registry route custom settings.
pluginRegistryUrl: Public URL of the plugin registry, that serves sample ready-to-use devfiles. Set this ONLY if a use of an external devfile registry is needed. See the `externalPluginRegistry` field. By default, this will be automatically calculated by the Operator.
proxyPassword: Password of the proxy server. Only use when proxy configuration is required (See also the `proxyURL`, `proxyUser` and `proxySecret` fields).
proxyPort: Port of the proxy server. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. (See also the `proxyURL` and `nonProxyHosts` fields).
proxySecret: The secret that contains `user` and `password` for a proxy server. When the secret is defined, the `proxyUser` and `proxyPassword` are ignored.
proxyURL: URL (protocol+host name) of the proxy server. This drives the appropriate changes in the `JAVA_OPTS` and `https(s)_proxy` variables in the Che server and workspaces containers. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `proxyUrl` in a custom resource leads to overrides the cluster proxy configuration with fields `proxyUrl`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUser` and `proxyPassword` from the custom resource. (see the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html) (see also the `proxyPort` and `nonProxyHosts` fields).
proxyUser: User name of the proxy server. Only use when configuring a proxy is required (see also the `proxyURL`, `proxyPassword` and `proxySecret` fields).
selfSignedCert: Deprecated. The value of this flag is ignored. The Che Operator will automatically detect if the router certificate is self-signed and propagate it to other components, such as the Che server.
serverCpuLimit: Overrides the cpu limit used in the Che server deployment In cores. (500m = .5 cores). Default to 1.
serverCpuRequest: Overrides the cpu request used in the Che server deployment In cores. (500m = .5 cores). Default to 100m.
serverExposureStrategy: Sets the server and workspaces exposure type. Possible values are `multi-host`, `single-host`, `default-host`. Defaults to `multi-host` which creates a separate ingress (or route on OpenShift) for every required endpoint. `single-host` makes Che exposed on a single host name with workspaces exposed on subpaths. Read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach. Also consult the `singleHostExposureType` property to further configure how the Operator and the Che server make that happen on Kubernetes. `default-host` exposes the Che server on the host of the cluster. Please read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach.
serverMemoryLimit: Overrides the memory limit used in the Che server deployment. Defaults to 1Gi.
serverMemoryRequest: Overrides the memory request used in the Che server deployment. Defaults to 512Mi.
serverTrustStoreConfigMapName: Name of the configMap with public certificates to add to Java trust store of the Che server. This is often required when adding the OpenShift OAuth provider which has https endpoint signed with self-signed cert. The Che server must be aware of its CA cert to be able to request it. This is disabled by default.
singleHostGatewayConfigMapLabels: The labels that need to be present (and are put) on the configmaps representing the gateway configuration.
singleHostGatewayConfigSidecarImage: The image used for the gateway sidecar that provides configuration to the gateway. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.
singleHostGatewayImage: The image used for the gateway in the single host mode. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.
tlsSupport: Deprecated. Instructs the Operator to deploy Che in TLS mode. This is enabled by default. Disabling TLS sometimes cause malfunction of some Che components.
useInternalClusterSVCNames: Use internal cluster svc names to communicate between components to speed up the traffic and avoid proxy issues. The default value is `false`.
workspaceNamespaceDefault: Defines Kubernetes default namespace in which user's workspaces are created if user does not override it. It's possible to use <username>, <userid> and <workspaceid> placeholders (e.g.\: che-workspace-<username>). In that case, new namespace will be created for each user (or workspace). Is used by OpenShift infrastructure as well to specify Project.
