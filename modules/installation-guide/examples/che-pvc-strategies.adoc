|*common (default)* |
One PVC for all workspaces in one {platforms-namespace}


| Easy to manage and control storage | If PV does not support `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode, the configuration will work only if one or both of the following apply:

* Each workspace is in a separate {platforms-namespace}

* Only one workspace is running per {platforms-namespace} at the same time. See xref:installation-guide:configuring-the-number-of-workspaces-that-a-user-can-run.adoc[].
|*per-workspace* |

One PVC for one workspace

| Easier to manage and control storage compared to unique strategy  | PV count is not known and depends on the number of workspaces
|*unique* |

One PVC per workspace volume or user-defined PVC

| Storage isolation | An undefined number of PVs are required
