= Switching between external and internal DNS names in inter-component communication

By default, new {prod-short} deployments use {orch-name} services DNS names for communications between {prod-short} server, {identity-provider}, registries, and helps with:

* Bypassing proxy, certificates, and firewalls issues
* Speeding up the traffic

This type of communication is an alternative to the external method of inter-component communication, which uses {platforms-ingress} cluster hostnames. In the situations described below, using {orch-name} internal DNS names is not supported. By disabling the use of the internal cluster hostname in inter-component communication, the communication using external {platforms-ingress} will come into effect.

.Internal inter-component communication restrictions in {platforms-name}

* The {prod-short} components are deployed across multi-cluster {platforms-name} environments.
* The {orch-name} NetworkPolicies restricts communication between namespaces.

The following section describes how to enable and disable the external inter-component communication for {platforms-ingress}.


.Prerequisites

* The `{orch-cli}` tool is available.
* An instance of {prod-short} running in {platforms-name}.


.Procedure

Switching between external and internal inter-component communication method is reached through the update against Custom Resource (CR).

. To use external {platforms-ingress} in inter-component communication:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} patch checluster {prod-checluster} -n {prod-namespace} --type=json -p \
'[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/server/useInternalClusterSVCNames", "value": false}]'
----

. To use internal {orch-name} DNS names in the inter-component communication:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} patch checluster {prod-checluster} -n {prod-namespace} --type=json -p \
'[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/server/useInternalClusterSVCNames", "value": true}]'
----
