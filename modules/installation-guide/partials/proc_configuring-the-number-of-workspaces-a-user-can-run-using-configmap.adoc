= Configuring the number of workspaces a user can run using ConfigMap

This procedure describes how to run more than one workspace simultaneously using ConfigMap. 

.Prerequisites
* An instance of `{prod-short}` installed using ConfigMap.
Each new workspace creates at least one new mount point to the storage (PV), in write mode. The default `common` storage strategy in `ReadWriteOnce` access mode reuses the same PV to physically store all data from multiple volumes of all workspaces of the same user, and doesn't support multiple mount points. Therefore to increase the number of simultaneously running workspaces, the combination of PVC strategy and access mode must meet the following criteria:
+
--
** `ReadWriteMany` access mode and an arbitrary PVC strategy
** `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy
--
+
For more information, see xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].
* Determine the values of the following placeholders:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| `_<product-namespace>_`
| The namespace of the product. The default option for `{platforms-namespace}` is `{prod-namespace}`.

| `_<number-of-workspaces>_`
| The number of workspaces a user can run simultaneously. The default value is `1`. If the value is `-1`, an unlimited number of workspaces can run per user. If it is a precise positive value, that many workspaces can run per user.
