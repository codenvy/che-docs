= Configuring the number of workspaces a user can run using ConfigMap

This procedure describes how to run more than one workspace simultaneously using ConfigMap. 

.Prerequisites
* An instance of `{prod-short}` installed using ConfigMap.
* The combination of PVC strategy and access mode meets the following criteria:
+
--
** `ReadWriteMany` access mode and an arbitrary PVC strategy
** `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy
--
+
For more information, see xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].
* Determine the values of the following placeholders:
+ 
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| `_<product-namespace>_`
| The namespace of the product. The default option for `{platforms-namespace}` is `{prod-namespace}`.

| `_<number-of-workspaces>_`
| The number of workspaces to run simultaneously. The default value is `1`. Set the value to `-1` to allow the user to run an unlimited number of concurrent workspaces. Set it to a precise value to allow running that many concurrent workspaces.
