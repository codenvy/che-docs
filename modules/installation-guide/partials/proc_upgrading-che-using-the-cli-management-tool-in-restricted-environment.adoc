= Upgrading {prod-short} using the CLI management tool in restricted environment

This section describes how to upgrade from previous minor version using the CLI management tool in restricted environment.

[NOTE]
====
The following method of upgrading an older version of {prod-short} in restricted environment is specific to OpenShift 3.11 and 4.x, but it is only relevant when the existing instance has been installed using the {prod-cli} `--installer operator` method, which is the default installation method for OpenShift 3.11.

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
This method is also available for instances deployed on Kubernetes.

.Prerequisites

* An administrative account on an OpenShift instance.

* A running instance of a previous minor version of {prod}, installed using the CLI management tool on the same instance of OpenShift, in the `_<{prod-namespace}>_` project.

* Essential container images are available to the {prod-short} server running in the cluster. See xref:pulling-images-used-by-che-to-a-private-registry.adoc[].

* The `{prod-cli}` {prod-ver} management tool is installed. See xref:overview:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].

.Procedure

. In all running workspaces in the {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} instance, save and push changes back to the Git repositories.

. Terminate all workspaces in the {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} instance.

. Run the following command:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} server:update --che-operator-image=__<image-registry>__/__<organization>__/{prod-operator-image-name}:{prod-ver} -n {prod-namespace}
----
+
* _<image-registry>_: A host name and a port of the container-image registry accessible in the restricted environment.
* _<organization>_: An organization of the container-image registry. See: xref:pulling-images-used-by-che-to-a-private-registry.adoc[].

.Verification steps

. Navigate to the {prod-short} instance.

. The {prod-ver} version number is visible at the bottom of the page.

[NOTE]
====
For slow systems or internet connections, add the `--k8spodwaittimeout=1800000` flag option to the `{prod-cli} server:update` command to extend the Pod timeout period to 1800000 ms or longer.

* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
