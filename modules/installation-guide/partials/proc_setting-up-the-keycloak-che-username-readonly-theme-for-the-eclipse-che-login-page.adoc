= Setting up the {identity-provider} {prod-id-short}-username-readonly theme for the {prod2} login page

The following procedure is relevant for all {prod-short} instances with the enabled OpenShift OAuth service.

After a user log in to {identity-provider} for the first time using the OpenShift credentials, a page allowing the user to update the account information displays. The user can change his username that was automatically created during the first login, but then a change to the Keycloak settings need to be done. Keeping the changed username without the steps mention below will prevent the user's workspaces from running.


.Prerequisites

* An instance of {prod-short} running in OpenShift.
* A user is logged in to the {identity-provider} service.

.Procedure

After changing a username, set the Login Theme option to `readonly`.

. In the main *Configure* menu on the left, select *Realm Settings*
+

. Navigate to the *Themes* tab.

. In the *Login Theme* field, select the `{prod-id-short}-username-readonly` option and click btn:[Save] to apply the changes.
