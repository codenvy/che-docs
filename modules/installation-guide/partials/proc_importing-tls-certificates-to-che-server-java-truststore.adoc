= Importing external or additional TLS certificates to {prod-short}

Network communications between the components of a {prod-short} installation and the started workspaces, are all secured through the TLS protocol, and thus require the use of trusted certificate authorities. 

In standard installations performed with the {prod-short} operator, the operator itself takes care of setting up and propagating the required TLS certificates, and no manual step should be necessary.

But in some cases it can be necessary to add TLS certificates to the {prod-short} installation, and have them used as trusted certificate authorities by {prod-short}.

Typical cases that may require this addition are:

* when using some specific configuration of the underlying Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster,
* to provide access to external secured services such as {identity-provider}or a Git server, from either the {prod-short} installation or the developer workspaces.

.Prerequisites

* The `{orch-cli}` tool is available.

.Procedure

// IF with the operator:
//   Look into the Custom Resource to find out if the field of the config map name exists
//   => config map name == this, else create 
//   


. Save the external services certificates to a local file system.

. Create a new configMap with the required TLS certificates:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} create configmap __<configMap-name>__ --from-file=__<certificate-file-path>__ -n=__<{project-context}-namespace-name>__ -o yaml --dry-run | {orch-cli} apply -f -
----
+
To apply more than one certificate, add another `--from-file=_<certificate-file-path>_` option to the above command.

. Update the existing {prod-short} server configuration
+
NOTE: Use these steps with existing instances of {prod-short}. To install a new instance of {prod-short} with self-signed TLS certificates, create a new `CheCluster` Custom Resource or Helm Chart property, based on the installation method selected, instead of updating the existing configuration.

====
** For a {prod-short} link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html[Operators] deployment:

* Define a name for the newly created configMap by editing the `spec.server.ServerTrustStoreConfigMapName` `CheCluster` Custom Resource property to match the previously created configMap:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} patch checluster {prod-checluster} -n che --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/server/serverTrustStoreConfigMapName", "value": "__<config-map-name>__"}]'
----
====
+
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
====
** For a {prod-short} link:https://helm.sh/[Helm Chart] deployment: 
+
. Clone the https://github.com/eclipse/che[che] project.
. Go to the `deploy/kubernetes/helm/che` directory.
. Define a name for the newly created configMap by editing the `global.tls.serverTrustStoreConfigMapName` Helm Chart property to match the previously created configMap:
+
[subs="+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ helm upgrade che -n che --set global.tls.serverTrustStoreConfigMapName=__<config-map name>__ \
   --set global.ingressDomain=__<kubernetes-cluster-domain>__ .
----
+
When using Minikube to run {prod-short}, substitute _<kubernetes-cluster-domain>_ with `$(minikube ip).nip.io`.

.Verification 

If the certificates have been added correctly, the {prod-short} server starts and obtains {identity-provider} configuration over HTTPS. Otherwise here is a list of things to verify: 

- CheCluster attribute `serverTrustStoreConfigMapName` value matches the name of the ConfigMap. Get the value using the following command :
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} get -o json checluster/{prod-checluster} -n {prod-namespace} | jq .spec.server.serverTrustStoreConfigMapName
----
+
- {prod-short} Pod Volumes list contains one Volume that uses the ConfigMap as data-source. To get the list of Volumes of the {prod-short} Pod:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} get po -o json __<{prod-id-short}-pod-name>__ -n {prod-namespace} | jq .spec.volumes
----
+
- Certificates are mounted in folder `/public-certs/` of the {prod-short} server container. This command returns the list of files in that folder:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} exec -t __<{prod-id-short}-pod-name>__ -n {prod-namespace} -- ls /public-certs/
----
+
- In the {prod-short} server logs there is a line for every certificate added to the Java truststore, including {prod-short} self signed certificate.
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} logs __<{prod-id-short}-pod-name>__ -n {prod-namespace}
(...)
Found a custom cert. Adding it to java trust store based on /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts
(...)
----
+
- ${prod-short} server Java trustore contains the certificates. The certificates SHA1 fingerpints are among the list of the SHA1 of the certificates included in the trustore returned by the following command:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ {orch-cli} exec -t __<{prod-id-short}-pod-name>__ -n {prod-namespace} -- keytool -list -keystore /home/che/cacerts
Your keystore contains 141 entries

(...)
----
+
To get the SHA1 hash of a certificate on the local filesystem:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ openssl x509 -in __<certificate-file-path>__ -fingerprint -noout
SHA1 Fingerprint=3F:DA:BF:E7:A7:A7:90:62:CA:CF:C7:55:0E:1D:7D:05:16:7D:45:60
