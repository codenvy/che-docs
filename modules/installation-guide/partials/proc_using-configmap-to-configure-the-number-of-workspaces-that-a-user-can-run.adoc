= Using ConfigMap to configure the number of workspaces that a user can run 

This procedure describes how to use ConfigMap to run more than one workspace simultaneously. By running multiple workspaces, users can use different work environments simultaneously.  

.Prerequisites

* You have installed an instance of `{prod-short}` by using ConfigMap and the default namespace `{prod-namespace}`.
* The combination of PVC strategy and access mode meets the following criteria:
+
--
** `ReadWriteMany` access mode and an arbitrary PVC strategy
** `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy
--
+
See xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].
* You have determined the value of the `_<number-of-workspaces>_` placeholder.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the value is `-1`, an unlimited number of workspaces can run per user. If the value is a positive integer, users can run as many workspaces as the value of the integer. The default value is `1`.
