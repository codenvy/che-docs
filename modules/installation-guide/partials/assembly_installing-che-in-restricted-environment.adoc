:context: installing-{prod-id-short}-in-a-restricted-environment

The following sections describe how to deploy {prod-short} in a {platforms-name} cluster in a restricted environment (also called _offline mode_ or _air-gap scenario_).

By default, {prod} workspaces reference various external resources, including container images available in public registries or sample projects hosted on GitHub.

To deploy {prod-short} in an environment where these external resources are not available (for example, on a cluster that is not exposed to the public Internet):

* Build images containing external resources (workspace plug-ins, projects).
* Pull all images needed for running {prod-short} to a registry that is accessible.
* Configure {prod-short} to use these images.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster using the developer account.

* Dynamic provisioning or pre-defined PVs configured before the deployment.

* Block-based storage volume or NFS share available outside of the cluster to serve dynamic storage provisioning or PVs. Block-based storage is recommended for optimal performance.
