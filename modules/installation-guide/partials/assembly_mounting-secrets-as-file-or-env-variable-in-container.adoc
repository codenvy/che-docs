= Mounting a secret as a file or an environment variable into a {prod} container

:context: mounting-a-secret-as-a-file-or-an-environment-variable-into-a-eclipse-che-container

Secrets are {platforms-name} objects that store sensitive data such as user names, passwords, authentication tokens, and configurations in an encrypted form.

Users can mount a {platforms-name} secret that contains sensitive data in a {prod} container as:

* a file
* an environment variable

The mounting process uses the standard {platforms-name} mounting mechanism, but it requires additional annotations and labeling.
