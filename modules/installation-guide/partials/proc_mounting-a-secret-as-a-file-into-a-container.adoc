[id="mounting-a-secret-as-a-file-into-a-container_{context}"]
= Mounting a secret as a file into a {prod} container


.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.


.Procedure

. Create a new {platforms-name} secret in the {platforms-name} {orch-namespace} where a {prod-short} is deployed. The labels of the secret that is about to be created must match the set of labels:

* `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org`
* `app.kubernetes.io/component: <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>-secret`

Where `<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>` is one of the following deployments: `postgres`, `keycloak`, `devfile-registry`, `plugin-registry` or `{prod-deployment}`

// The following content is downstream friendly

.Example:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-certificate
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: {prod-deployment}-secret
...
----


Annotations must indicate that the given secret is mounted as a file. Set up the annotation values:

* `che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file` - to indicate that a secret is mounted as a file
* `che.eclipse.org/mount-path: _<FOO_ENV>_` - to provide a required mount path


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-certificate
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /custom-certificates
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
  labels:
...
----


The {orch-name} secret may contain several items whose names must match the desired file name mounted into the container.

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-certificate
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: {prod-deployment}-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /custom-certificates
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
data:
  ca.crt: __<base64 encoded data content here>__
----

This results in a file named `ca.crt` being mounted at the `/custom-certificates` path of {prod-short} container.
