= Configuring the number of workspaces a user can run using the Operator

This procedure describes how to run more than one workspace simultaneously using the Operator. 

.Prerequisites
* An instance of `{prod-short}` installed using the Operator.
* The combination of PVC strategy and access mode meets the following criteria:
+
--
** `ReadWriteMany` access mode and an arbitrary PVC strategy
** `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy
--
+
For more information, see xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].
* Determine the value of the following placeholder:

|===
| `_<number-of-workspaces>_`
| The number of workspaces a user can run simultaneously. The default value is `1`. If the value is `-1`, an unlimited number of workspaces can run per user. If it is a precise positive value, that many workspaces can run per user.
