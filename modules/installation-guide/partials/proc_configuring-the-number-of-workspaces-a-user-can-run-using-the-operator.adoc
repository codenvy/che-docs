= Configuring the number of workspaces a user can run using the Operator

This procedure describes how to run more than one workspace simultaneously using the Operator. 

.Prerequisites
* An instance of {prod-short} installed by using the Operator
* The storage configuration is one of the following:
. `common` PVC strategy and `ReadWriteMany` access mode
. `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy and `ReadWriteOnce` access mode
+
For more information, see xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].


.Procedure
. Define the value of the placeholder:
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| `_<number-of-workspaces>_`
| The number of workspaces to run simultaneously. The default value is `1`. Set the value to `-1` to allow the user to run an unlimited number of concurrent workspaces. Set it to a precise value to allow running that many concurrent workspaces.
|===
. In `CheCluster` Custom Resource `server` settings, add the `+CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT+` property to `customCheProperties`:
