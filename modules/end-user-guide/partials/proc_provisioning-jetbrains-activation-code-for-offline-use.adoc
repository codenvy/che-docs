= Provisioning JetBrains activation code for offline use

An activation code for offline use is a file with a license code that can be retrieved from the license management section of your JetBrains account for the license that is assigned to you. When you purchase a personal subscription or are assigned a commercial subscription by your organization, you receive an email prompting you to create a JetBrains account that becomes connected with the license.

NOTE: When using an activation code to activate a product, you need to generate a new activation code and apply it to your product each time the subscription is renewed.

.Prerequisites

* JetBrains account
* Personal or organization subscription

.Procedure

. Retrieve the activation code from the JetBrains account:

JetBrains provides a zip archive with two types of the activation code. Use the `<License{nbsp}ID>{nbsp}-{nbsp}for{nbsp}2018.1{nbsp}or{nbsp}later.txt` file:

. Provision the activation code for offline use with {prod-short}. This procedure is performed through the {orch-name} Secrets.

. Create a {orch-name} Secret to instruct {prod-short} to mount the activation code into a container based on JetBrains specific product:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: _<secret name>_ <1>
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret: 'false'
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /tmp/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
data:
  __<product name (ideaIU or WebStorm)>__.key: _<base64-encoded data content>_ <2>
----
<1> `<secret name>` – The section that specifies the secret name. It may have a different name, for example, `ideaiu-offline-activation-code`. Provide the secret name in lowercase.
<2> Product name and activation code:
* `<product name (ideaIU or WebStorm)>` – Replace with the JetBrains product name. See section
xref:jetbrains-product-name-mapping[].
* `<base64-encoded data content>` – The activation code content encoded in base64.

Use the `automount-workspace-secret` option set to `false` to disable the mounting process until it is explicitly requested in a devfile component using the `automountWorkspaceSecrets:true` property. See the `workspace.yaml` example file above. This is the default behavior to avoid mounting the activation code into every container except specific ones that have to work with it.

As a result, in the Che Editor, the file with the activation code for offline use is mounted to the `/tmp/ideaIU.key` or `/tmp/WebStorm.key` path (or similar - based on the type of the build).

IntelliJ Idea Community Edition does not require this procedure. This has to be done for JetBrains products that need to be registered.
