= Using IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition

.Procedure

. Clone the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/tree/cdc002c5c1a9f7376acc40b0b04039b413d4bf04[jetbrains-editor-images] repository, needed for building IntelliJ Idea Community Edition located under the _che-incubator_ organization.

. Build IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition by calling the following command inside the repository folder:
+
----
$ podman build -t idea-iu --build-arg PRODUCT_NAME=ideaIU .
----
+
This command builds an image with a `2020.2.3` version by default.

. Tag and push the built image to a user repository:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ podman tag idea-iu:latest __<username>__/idea-iu:latest
$ podman push __<username>__/idea-iu:latest
----

. Provision the activation code for offline use to be able to use WebStorm with a registered license. See section xref:provisioning-jetbrains-activation-code-for-offline-use.adoc[].

. Create a workspace with the following `workspace.yaml` and `meta.yaml` files:
+
* `workspace.yaml` – workspace configuration. Do not forget to provide a correct URL to the `meta.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
metadata:
  name: che-ideaiu
components:
  - type: cheEditor
    reference: '__<URL to the meta.yaml>__'
    alias: ideaiu-editor
    automountWorkspaceSecrets: true
apiVersion: 1.0.0
----
+
NOTE: In the current workspace definition, there is a new property: `automountWorkspaceSecrets: true`. This property instructs {prod} to provision secrets into a specific component. In this case, it provisions it into the {prod-short} editor based on IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition. This parameter is *mandatory* to successfully register the IDE with an activation code for offline use.

* `meta.yaml` – {prod-short} editor configuration. Do not forget to replace `<username>` with the user name of the repository to which the image is pushed:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
