:context: authoring-devfiles-version-2

When you author or edit a devfile for configuring a workspace, the devfile must meet the devfile 2.1.0 specification.

.Prerequisites
* An instance of {prod-short} with the xref:installation-guide:enabling-dev-workspace-engine.adoc[DevWorkspace Operator] enabled
+
To install {prod-short}, see xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[Installing {prod-short}].

.Procedure
//TODO - Figure out whether we want to duplicate, single source or just reference devfile docs here

* To author or edit a devfile 2.1.0, follow the instructions in the link:https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/2.0.0/user-guide/authoring-stacks.html[Devfile User Guide].

.Additional resources

* For more information about devfile object schema and object properties, see link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile[Introduction to Devfiles].
//To note, the page linked to on the preceeding line discusses devfile 1.0.0., which readers here might find confusing. max-cx

////
Hesitant to add "version" here for these reasons:
. The "version" in this text refers to the devfile's format or specification; the devfile itself has no "version 1" or "version 2".
. Having a title on "authoring a devfile version" seems a bit distracting to me, as it's about authoring a devfile, not about authoring a version.
. The IMB Style Guide on p. 185 seems to suggest not using "version" when referring to a product name and alternatively using only "version" on its own as a generic reference without the product name.
