= Allowing users to define workspace creation strategy


As a developer, you can configure {prod-short} to create a new workspace each time it accepts a factory URL, or to reuse the existing workspace if a user already has one. {prod-short} currently supports the following options: 

* `perclick`:  Create a new workspace each time the same factory URL is accepted. The default value.

* `peruser`: `peruser` creation strategy will re-use an existing workspace for second and any other subsequent acceptance of the same factory URL.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. See xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].
* The Git repository __<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__ is available over HTTPS.


.Procedure

pass:[<!-- vale CheDocs.TechnicalTerms = NO -->]

* Run the workspace by opening the factory URL and specify the additional policy parameter:
+
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/f?url=__<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>&policies.create=<value>__]`
+

pass:[<!-- vale CheDocs.TechnicalTerms = YES -->]
