= Allowing users to define workspace creation strategy


This section describes how to control strategy of creation a {prod-short} workspace using a factory URL.
Currently, two options for workspace creation strategy are supported: 

* `perclick` (default) - means creation of new workspace each time same factory URL is accepted.

* `peruser` - means re-use existing workspace for 2nd and any subsequent acceptance of the same factory URL.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod}. See xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].
* The Git repository __<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__ is available over HTTPS.


.Procedure

pass:[<!-- vale CheDocs.TechnicalTerms = NO -->]

* Run the workspace by opening the factory URL, with additional policy parameter specified:
+
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/f?url=__<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>&policies.create=<value>__]`
+

pass:[<!-- vale CheDocs.TechnicalTerms = YES -->]
