= Testing a Visual Studio Code extension in {prod-short}

:context: testing-a-visual-studio-code-extension-in-{prod-id-short}

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions work in a workspace. VS Code extensions can run in the Che-Theia editor container, or in their own isolated and preconfigured containers with their prerequisites.

This section describes how to test a VS Code extension in {prod-short} with workspaces and how to review the compatibility of VS Code extensions to check whether a specific API is available.

NOTE: The extension-hosting sidecar container and the use of the extension in a devfile are optional.
