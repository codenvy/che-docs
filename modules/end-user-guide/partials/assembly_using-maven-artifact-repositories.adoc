:context: using-maven-artifact-repositories

Maven downloads artifacts that are defined in two locations:

* Artifact repositories defined in a `pom.xml` file of the project. Configuring repositories in `pom.xml` is not specific to {prod}. For more information, see link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html[the Maven documentation about the POM].
* Artifact repositories defined in a `settings.xml` file. By default, `settings.xml` is located at ``~/.m2/settings.xml`.
