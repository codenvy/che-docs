= Authenticating on Bitbucket servers

{prod} users may use public or private repositories on Bitbucket SCM (Source Code Management) system as a source of their projects.

The use of private repositories, requires some additional configuration described below.

Bitbucket authentication is based on using personal access tokens. Each Bitbucket user is able to request some
amount of personal access tokens with different names, permissions, expiration times, and so on. Those tokens
can be used to sign Bitbucket REST API calls and perform Git repository operations.

To allow Bitbucket authentication on {prod} side, personal tokens must be stored in user's namespace in a form of
secret. The secret must look as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$snip_bitbucket-personal-access-token-secret.adoc[]
----

The main parts of the secret are:

[cols=3*]
|===
| Label
| `app.kubernetes.io/component`
| Indicates it is a SCM personal token secret. 

| Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/che-userid`
| {prod} id of the user token belongs to

| Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-userid`
| Bitbucket user id to which token belongs

| Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-username`
| Bitbucket user name to which token belongs

| Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-url`
| Bitbucket server URL to which this token belong

| Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/expired-after`
| Personal access token expiration time

| Data entry
| `token`
| Base-64 encoded value of the personal access token

|===

Bitbucket user id can be obtained with call to REST API:
----
https://{bitbucket-hostname}/rest/api/1.0/users/{username}
----

and for {prod} the user API URL is
----
https://{che-hostname}/api/user
----

Using the token credential provided in this secret, another one is automatically created to allow authorized Git operations. It will be mount
into workspace containers as Git credentials file. Users don't have to perform any additional configurations to be able to work
with private Git repositories.
