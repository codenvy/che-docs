= The use of annotations in the process of mounting a secret into a workspace container

{kubernetes} annotations and labels are tools used by libraries, tools, and other clients, to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to {platforms-name} native objects. 

Labels select objects and connect them to a collection that satisfies certain conditions, where annotations are used for non-identifying information that is not used by {platforms-name} objects internally.

This section describes {platforms-name} annotation values used in the process of {platforms-name} secret mounting in a {prod-short} workspace.

Annotations must contain items that help identify the proper mounting configuration. These items are:
