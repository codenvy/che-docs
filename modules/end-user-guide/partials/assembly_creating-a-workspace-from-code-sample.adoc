:context: creating-a-workspace-from-code-sample

Every stack includes a sample codebase, which is defined by the devfile of the stack. This section explains how to create a workspace from this code sample in a sequence of three procedures.

. Creating a workspace from the user dashboard:
.. Using the xref:creating-a-workspace-from-get-started-view-of-user-dashboard_{context}[Get Started view].
.. Using the xref:creating-a-workspace-from-custom-workspace-view-of-user-dashboard_{context}[Custom Workspace view].
. xref:changing-the-configuration-of-an-existing-workspace_{context}[Changing the configuration of the workspace] to add code sample.
. xref:running-an-existing-workspace-from-the-user-dashboard_{context}[Running an existing workspace from the user dashboard].
