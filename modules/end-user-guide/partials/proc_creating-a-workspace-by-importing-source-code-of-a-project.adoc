= Creating a workspace by importing the source code of a project

:context: creating-a-workspace-by-importing-source-code-of-a-project

This section describes how to create a new workspace to edit an existing codebase.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.

* An existing workspace with plug-ins related to your development environment defined on this instance of {prod} xref:creating-and-configuring-a-new-workspace.adoc[].

You can do it in two ways *before* starting a workspace:

* xref:#creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}[Select a sample from the Dashboard, then change the devfile to include your project]
* xref:configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile.adoc[]

To create a new workspace to edit an existing codebase, use one of the following three methods *after* you have started the workspace:

* xref:#importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}[Import from the *Dashboard* into an existing workspace]
* xref:#importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}[Import to a running workspace using the `git clone` command]
* xref:#importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}[Import to a running workspace using `git clone` in a terminal]

[id="creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}"]
== Select a sample from the Dashboard, then change the devfile to include your project

* In the left navigation panel, go to *Get Started*.

* Click the *Custom Workspace* tab if it's not already selected.

* In the *Devfile* section, select the devfile template that will be used to build and run projects.

* In the *Devfile editor*, update `projects` section:

[NOTE]
.Example: add a project
====
To add a project into the workspace, add or edit the following section:

[source,yaml]
----
projects:
  - name: che
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/eclipse/che.git'
----
See the xref:making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile.adoc#devfile-reference_{context}[].
====

* To open the workspace, click the btn:[Create & Open] button.

[id="importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}"]
== Importing from the Dashboard into an existing workspace

. Import the project. There are at least two ways to import a project using the *Dashboard*.
+
* From the *Dashboard*, select *Workspaces*, then select your workspace by clicking on its name. This will link you to the workspace's *Overview* tab.

* Or, use the gear icon. This will link to the *Devfile* tab where you can enter your own YAML configuration.
+
. Click the *Projects* tab.
. Click *Add Project*. You can then import project by a repository Git URL or from GitHub.

[NOTE]
====
You can add a project to a non-running workspace, but you must start the workspace to delete it.
====

=== Editing the commands after importing a project

After you have a project in your workspace, you can add commands to it. Adding commands to your projects allows you to run, debug, or launch your application in a browser.

To add commands to the project:

. Open the workspace configuration in the *Dashboard*, then select the *Devfile* tab.
+
image::workspaces/workspace-config-yaml.png[Add commands to workspace]

. Open the workspace.

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task* from the main menu.
+
image::workspaces/run-command.png[Run task]

. To configure commands, select *Terminal* > *Configure Tasks* from the main menu.
+

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}"]
== Importing to a running workspace using the *Git: Clone* command

To import to a running workspace using the *Git: Clone* command:

. Start a workspace, then use the *Git: Clone* command from the command palette or the Welcome screen to import a project to a running workspace.
+
image::workspaces/{project-context}-welcome.png[Welcome screen]

. Open the command palette using `F1` or `CTRL-SHIFT-P`, or from the link in the Welcome screen.
+
image::workspaces/git-clone-command.png[Invoke git clone command]

. Enter the path to the project you want to clone.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}"]
== Importing to a running workspace with `git clone` in a terminal

In addition to the approaches above, you can also start a workspace, open a *Terminal*, and type `git clone` to pull code.

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update the workspace configuration, and the change is not reflected in the *Project* and *Devfile* tabs in the dashboard.

Similarly, if you add a project using the *Dashboard*, then delete it with `rm -fr myproject`, it may still appear in the *Projects* or *Devfile* tab.
