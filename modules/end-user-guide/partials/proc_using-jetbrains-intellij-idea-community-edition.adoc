= Using IntelliJ Idea Community Edition

.Procedure

. Clone the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/che-editor-intellij-community[che-editor-intellij-community] repository, which is needed to build IntelliJ Idea Community Edition located under the _che-incubator_ organization.

. Build IntelliJ Idea Community Edition by calling the following command inside the repository folder:
+
----
$ podman build -t idea-ic --build-arg PRODUCT_NAME=ideaIC .
----
+
This command builds an image with a `2020.2.3` version by default.

. Tag and push the built image to a user repository:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ podman tag idea-ic:latest __<username>__/idea-ic:latest
$ podman push __<username>__/idea-ic:latest
----

. Use this image as the {prod-short} editor. To achieve this, create two YAML configuration files:
+
* `workspace.yaml` – workspace configuration. Do not forget to provide a correct URL to the `meta.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
metadata:
  name: che-ideaic
components:
  - type: cheEditor
    reference: '__<URL to the meta.yaml>__'
    alias: ideaic-editor
apiVersion: 1.0.0
----

* `meta.yaml` – {prod-short} editor configuration. Do not forget to replace `<username>` with the user name of the repository to which the image is pushed:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
