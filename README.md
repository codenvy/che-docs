## Eclipse Che documentation

Che docs use Jekyll to convert `.adoc` (AsciiDoc) files into HTML pages. Docs are published at [https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/). Updates are synced with a release cycle.

## Build and preview

### Building online
[![Contribute](https://che.openshift.io/factory/resources/factory-contribute.svg)](https://che.openshift.io/f?url=https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs)

### Building locally

Use a `run.sh` script in the root of the repo to build using a Docker image. The scipts runs a Docker image, mounts sources, and starts Jekyll. Docs are available at `localhost:4000`. Jekyll watches for changes in `.adoc` files and re-generates resources, so you can preview changes live.

To run the script:

* Execute the script from the command line:
```
$ bash run.sh    
```

* Open `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser.

## Adding new pages
Che documentation follows guidelines of the [Modular Documentation initiative](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/)

Use `newdoc` to generate templates for the new documentation.
To learn more about the script: [`newdoc` GitHub repository](https://github.com/redhat-documentation/tools/tree/master/newdoc)

### Using `newdoc` from the `che-docs` container
`newdoc` is built into the `che-docs` container.

To generate new documentation module with the script, run from the `che-docs` root git directory:

* Create a new assembly in a directory `directory_name` <sup id="a1">[directories](#f1)</sup>, with a title `your_title`

```
$ bash run.sh -newassembly <directory_name> <your_title>    
```

* Create a new concept in a directory `directory_name` <sup id="a1">[directories](#f1)</sup>, with a title `your_title` 
```
$ bash run.sh -newconcept  <directory_name> <your_title>       
```

* Create a new procedure in a directory `directory_name` <sup id="a1">[directories](#f1)</sup>, with a title `your_title`
```
$ bash run.sh -newprocedure  <directory_name> <your_title>     
```

* Create a new reference in a directory `directory_name` <sup id="a1">[directories](#f1)</sup>, with a title `your_title`
```
$ bash run.sh -newreference <directory_name> <your_title>
```

## Placing new documentation

To add a new page, create an `.adoc` file in `src/main/pages/che-<MAJOR-VERSION>/${subdir}` (substitute `<MAJOR-VERSION>` for either `6` or `7`, depending for which version of Che your content is intended).

<b id="f1">Available directories: </b> 
* overview - introductory section
* end-user-guide - documentation for developers: navigating dashboard, working in Che-Theia, and so on 
* installation-guide - installation guides
* administration-guide - documentation for administrators of the clusters: configuring Che on a cluster, managing users, monitoring resources, security and data recovery 
* contributor-guide - how to develop plug-ins for Che, add new debuggers, languages, and so on
* extensions - documentation about extentons for Che, such as Eclipse Che4z, OpenShift Connector

If there is no directory that fits a topic of your document, create a new one. Look at headers in existing pages to make sure the generated HTML page has the expected name, title, and keywords. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Installing single-user Che on Docker"
keywords: docker, installation
tags: [installation, docker]
sidebar: che_6_docs
permalink: docker-single-user.html
folder: setup
---
```

### Naming

Try to use short names and titles for pages. Use dashes (`-`) in page names (`permalink` in page header).

### Keywords

The search script uses page titles, summary, and keywords to search for relevant results. Make sure your keywords are relevant for the page you add.

### Tags

To add a tag, look at available tags in `src/main/pages/che-<MAJOR-VERSION>/tags` folder. Tags should be also registered in `src/main/_data/tags.yml` - so both a tag in `tags.yml` and a respective tag page should be created.

## Formatting and AsciiDoc syntax

See [AsciiDoc Writer's Guide](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) for syntax and general help with AsciiDoc.

### Links

To post a link to an internal page, use the following syntax:

```
This is a link:file_name.html[link to an internal page]
```

Do not use `.adoc` in the file name. Also, this file should be referenced in at least one sidebar-definition file in the `src/main/_data/sidebars/` directory.

Links to anchors in internal pages:

```
link:file_name.html#tag[link to an anchor on an internal page]
```

Links to external pages:

```
This is a link:https://github.com[link to an external site]
```

### Images

Images are located in the `src/main/che/docs/images/` directory. To publish an image, use the following syntax:

```
image::directory/img.png[alt text]
```

Do not add images into the root of the `images/` directory - either choose an existing sub-directory or create one if none of them fits the new image.

Images are sized automatically. You can provide a URL to a full-size image, as well as a caption and alt text:

```
.Click to view a larger image
[link=che/docs/images/devel/js_flow.png
image::devel/js_flow.png[Alt text]
```

Do not post too many images unless it is absolutely necessary. Animated `.gif` images are preferred, especially when explaining how to use complex UI features.

### Special characters

To prevent special characters from being interpreted as formatting mark-up, use pass-through macros. For example, to escape underscores, asterisks, or backticks, use:

```
pass:[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
```
