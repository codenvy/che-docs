Samsung ARTIK™ is the integrated Smart IoT platform providing the fastest path to secure, interoperable, and intelligent IoT products and services.

To get started developing for Samsung ARTIK™ use the Getting Started section on the right for your platform. Those guides will walk you through installation, configuration and a brief overview of the IDE itself.

The Samsung ARTIK™ IDE is powered by the open source Eclipse Che project so you will periodically see references to Eclipse Che in these docs.
