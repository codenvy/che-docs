This chapter describes how to customize the Che-Theia interface and branding. Customization is possible for the following elements:

* *Welcome* page and *About* dialog:
** Product name
** Product logo
** Description
** List of helpful resources (*Help* section of the *Welcome* page)

To start using the customized Che-Theia:

. Build a container image with the customized Che-Theia.
. Define an editor `meta.yaml` that uses the custom image.
. Create a workspace from a devfile using the custom editor.
