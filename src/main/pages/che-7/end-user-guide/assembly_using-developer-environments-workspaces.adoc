Eclipse Che provides developer workspaces with everything needed to a code, build, test, run, and debug applications. To allow that, the developer workspaces provide four main components:

Project source code:: the source code of a project
Browser-based IDE:: a web-based IDE that is packaged by default in a workspace
Tool dependencies:: dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
Application runtime:: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production
