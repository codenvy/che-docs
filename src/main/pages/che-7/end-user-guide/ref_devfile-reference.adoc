[id="devfile-reference_{context}"]
= Devfile reference

This section contains devfile reference and instructions on how to use the various elements that devfiles consist of.

== Adding components to a devfile

Each component in a single devfile must have a unique name.

=== Component type: cheEditor

Describes the editor used in the workspace by defining its `id`. A devfile can only contain one component of the `cheEditor` type.

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  - alias: theia-editor
    type: cheEditor
    id: eclipse/che-theia/next
----

When `cheEditor` is missing, a default editor is provided along with its default plug-ins. The default plug-ins are also provided for an explicitly defined editor with the same `id` as the default one (even if it is a different version). Che-Theia is configured as default editor along with the *Che Machine Exec* plug-in.

To specify that a workspace requires no editor, use the xref:attribute-editorfree_{context}[`editorFree:true` attribute] in the devfile attributes.

=== Component type: chePlugin

Describes plug-ins in a workspace by defining their `id`. It is allowed to have several `chePlugin` components.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
----

Both types above using id, which is slash-separated publisher, name and version of plugin from Che Plugin registry. +
List of available Che plugins and more information about registry can be found on https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry.

=== Specifying an alternative component registry

To specify an alternative registry for the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, use the `registryUrl` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     registryUrl: https://my-customregistry.com
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
----

=== Specifying a component by linking to its descriptor

An alternative way of specifying `cheEditor` or `chePlugin`, instead of using the editor or plug-in `id` (and optionally an alternative registry), is to provide a direct link to the component descriptor (typically named `meta.yaml`) by using the `reference` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com.../plugin/1.0.1/meta.yaml
----

NOTE: It is not possible to mix the `id` and `reference` fields in a single component definition; they are mutually exclusive.

=== Specifying container memory limit for components

To specify a container(s) memory limit for `cheEditor` or `chePlugin`, use the `memoryLimit` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
     memoryLimit: 256M
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

=== Tuning component configuration

A component may need to be precisely tuned, and in such case, component preferences can be used. The example shows how to configure JVM using plug-in preferences.

[source,yaml]
----
  id: redhat/java/0.38.0
  type: chePlugin
  preferences:
     java.jdt.ls.vmargs: '-noverify -Xmx1G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication'
----


=== Component type: kubernetes

A complex component type that allows to apply configuration from a Kubernetes or OpenShift lists. The content of the component can be provided either via the `reference` attribute, which points to the file with the component content.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
        app.kubernetes.io/component: database
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: petclinic
----

Alternatively, to post a devfile with such components to REST API, the contents of the Kubernetes or OpenShift list can be embedded into the devfile using the `referenceContent` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      referenceContent: |
           kind: List
           items:
            -
             apiVersion: v1
             kind: Pod
             metadata:
              name: ws
             spec:
              containers:
              ... etc
----

As with the xref:component-type-dockerimage_{context}[`dockerimage` component], it is possible to override the entrypoint of the containers contained in the Kubernetes or OpenShift list using the `command` and `args` properties (as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes[understood] by Kubernetes).

There can be more containers in the list (contained in pods or pod templates of deployments). To select which containers to apply the entrypoint changes to.

The entrypoints can be defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: appDeployment
      type: kubernetes
      reference: app-deployment.yaml
      entrypoints:
      - parentName: mysqlServer
        command: ['sleep']
        args: ['infinity']
      - parentSelector:
          app: prometheus
        args: ['-f', '/opt/app/prometheus-config.yaml']
----

The `entrypoints` list contains constraints for picking the containers along with the `command` and `args` parameters to apply to them. In the example above, the constraint is `parentName: mysqlServer`, which will cause the command to be applied to all containers defined in any parent object called `mysqlServer`. The parent object is assumed to be a top level object in the list defined in the referenced file, which is `app-deployment.yaml` in the example above.

Other types of constraints (and their combinations) are possible:

`containerName`:: the name of the container
`parentName`:: the name of the parent object that (indirectly) contains the containers to override
`parentSelector`:: the set of labels the parent object needs to have

A combination of these constraints can be used to precisely locate the containers inside the referenced Kubernetes list.

=== Specifying mounting sources option

To specify a project sources directory mount into container(s), use the `mountSources` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
   components:
      - alias: appDeployment
        type: kubernetes
        reference: app-deployment.yaml
        mountSources: true
----

If enabled, project source mounts will be applied to every container of the given component.
This parameter is also applicable for `chePlugin` type components.

[id="component-type-dockerimage_{context}"]
=== Component type: dockerimage

A component type that allows to define a container image-based configuration of a container in a workspace. A devfile can only contain one component of the `dockerimage` type.

[source,yaml]
----
 components:
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: eclipe/maven-jdk8:latest
     volumes:
       - name: mavenrepo
         containerPath: /root/.m2
     env:
       - name: ENV_VAR
         value: value
     endpoints:
       - name: maven-server
         port: 3101
         attributes:
           protocol: http
           secure: 'true'
           public: 'true'
           discoverable: 'false'
     memoryLimit: 1536M
     command: ['tail']
     args: ['-f', '/dev/null']
----


== Adding commands to a devfile

A devfile allows to specify commands to be available for execution in a workspace. Every command can contain a subset of actions, which are related to a specific component in whose container it will be executed.

[source,yaml]
----
 commands:
   - name: build
     actions:
       - type: exec
         component: mysql
         command: mvn clean
         workdir: /projects/spring-petclinic
----


== Devfile attributes

Devfile attributes can be used to configure various features.

[id="attribute-editorfree_{context}"]
=== Attribute: editorFree

When an editor is not specified in a devfile, a default is provided. When no editor is needed, the `editorFree` attribute should be used. The default value is `false`, and it means that the devfile needs the default editor to be provisioned.

.Example of a devfile without an editor
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: petclinic-dev-environment
components:
  - alias: myApp
    type: kubernetes
    local: my-app.yaml
attributes:
  editorFree: true
----

=== Attribute: persistVolumes (ephemeral mode)

By default, volumes and PVCs specified in a devfile are bound to a host folder to persist data even after a container restart. Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable data persistence, such as when volume backend is slow, and it is needed to make workspace faster. To achieve it, the `persistVolumes` devfile attribute should be used. The default value is `true`, and in case of `false`, `emptyDir` volumes will be used for configured volumes and PVC.

.Example of a devfile with ephemeral mode enabled
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: petclinic-dev-environment
projects:
  - name: petclinic
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/che-samples/web-java-spring-petclinic.git'
attributes:
  persistVolumes: false
