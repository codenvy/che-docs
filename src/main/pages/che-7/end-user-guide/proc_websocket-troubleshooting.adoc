.Browser support

Confirm that you are using a supported browser(Chrome or Firefox). If you are not, you should see a warning message about it.
Try using one of the supported browsers and then check if WebSockets are working with https://websocketstest.com/[realtime web test].

.Proxy servers and firewalls

Check if you have a proxy server or firewall that blocks WebSocket connections(you might be needed your system administrator's help).
WebSocket Secure (WSS) requires connection on port 443. You might need to: add an exception to your firewall
and/or have your proxy intercept WebSocket connection. Then check if WebSockets are working with https://websocketstest.com/[realtime web test].
