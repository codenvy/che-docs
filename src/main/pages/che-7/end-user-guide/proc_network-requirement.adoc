Enabling the WebSocket protocol is critical for the proper functionality of {prod-short} IDE.

While the WebSocket protocol itself is unaware of proxy servers and firewalls, HTTP servers can share their default HTTP and HTTPS ports with a WebSocket server.

* HTTP: port 80
* HTTPS: port 433

Some proxy servers operate with WebSockets by default, but others prevent WebSockets from working correctly, which causes the connection to fail.

In some cases, the proxy server requires the additional configuration, and the specific proxy servers need an upgrade, which allows WebSockets support.
