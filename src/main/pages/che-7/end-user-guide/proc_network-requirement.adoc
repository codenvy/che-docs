While the WebSocket protocol itself is unaware of proxy servers and firewalls, HTTP servers can share their default
HTTP and HTTPS ports(80 and 443) with a WebSocket server. Some proxy servers are harmless and work fine with WebSockets.
Others will prevent WebSockets from working correctly, causing the connection to fail. In some cases additional proxy server configuration
may be required and certain proxy servers may need to be upgraded to support WebSockets.
