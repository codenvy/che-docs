:context: using-alternative-ides-in-che

It is possible to plug different IDEs (integrated developent environments) to the Eclipse Che developer workspaces so that the following scenarios can be taken care of:

* Default IDE does not cover the use cases of your audience

* You want to provide a dedicated custom IDE for your tools

* Different stakeholders are using the workspaces and you might want to provide them with different perspectives

// In the traditional Eclipse IDE world, that was done with RCP applications.
// find out what's RCP?

Eclipse Che provides a default web IDE to be used with the developer workspaces. This IDE is completely decoupled. You can bring your own custom IDE for Eclipse Che:

* *Built from Eclipse Theia*, which is a framework to build web IDEs. Example: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6aCqywKpyY[Sirius on the web].
// TODO: Learn more link:[LINK].

* *Completely different web IDEs*, such as Jupyter, Eclipse Dirigible, or others. Example: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VooNzKxRFgw[Jupyter in Eclipse Che workspaces].

.Bringing custom IDE built from Eclipse Theia

* Creating your own custom IDE based on Eclipse Theia
* Adding Che-specific tools to your custom IDE
* Packaging your custom IDE into the available editors for Che
// TODO: all bullets needs links to docs

.Bringing completely different web IDE into Che

* Packaging your custom IDE into the available editors for Che
// TODO: bullet needs a lonk to docs

// is this supposed to be here twice?


// .Prerequisites
// 
// * A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.
// * You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
// * Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.
// 
// 
// Include modules here.
