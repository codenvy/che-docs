= Workspaces overview

Eclipse Che workspaces are managed by Kubernetes pods. Everything running in a Che developer workspace is running inside containers and is accessible from the embedded browser-based IDE. Because developer workspaces are containerized, they are highly portable. And because they only need a browser to be accessed, they are easily shareable.
