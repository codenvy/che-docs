= Creating a workspace by importing the source code of a project

This section is about how to create a new workspace to edit an existing codebase.

There are two ways to do that *before* starting a workspace:

* xref:#configure-devfile[Select a stack from the *Dashboard*, then change the devfile to include your project]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile[Add a devfile to a git repository and start the workspace using chectl or a factory]


To create a new workspace to edit an existing codebase, use one of the following three methods *after* you have started the workspace:

* xref:#importing-from-the-user-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace[Import from the *Dashboard* into an existing workspace]
* xref:#importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command[Import to a running workspace using the `git clone` command]
* xref:#importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal[Import to a running workspace using `git clone` in a terminal]

.Prerequisites

* You need an OKD, OCP, or OSD cluster, if using Che on Openshift. See below for use of link:https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift] (OKD).

* Or, you can use a Kubernetes cluster such as link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[Minikube].

* To install on Minishift or Minikube, see link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[Deploying Che using chectl].

* You need to have created a workspace with plugins related to your development environment.

== Importing from the Dashboard into an existing workspace

There are at least two ways to import a project via the *Dashboard*.

From the *Dashboard*, select Workspaces, then select your workspace by clicking on its name, or use the gear icon. The former will link you to the workspace's *Overview* tab, while the latter will link to the *Devfile* tab where you can enter your own YAML configuration.
You can import a project using the *Dashboard* in one of the following two ways:

* On the *Dashboard*, click *Workspaces*. Then, click the required workspace. The *Overview* tab displays showing the overview of the workspace.
* On the *Dashboard*, click *Workspaces*. Then, click the gear icon next to the required workspace. The *Devfile* tab displays allowing you to enter the YAML configuration.
In either case, click the *Projects* tab next.
. Click the *Projects* tab.

. Click *Add Project*. You can then import a sample project, create a blank project, import from a Git project, or import from a zip file.

[NOTE]
====
You can add a project to a non-running workspace, but you must start the workspace to delete it.

=== Creating a new repository

To add a blank project, take the following steps:

. Type a name and a description in the *Name* and *Description* fields.

. Click *Open* to open your workspace.

=== Edit an existing repository

To edit an existing repository, choose the git project or zip file, and Che will load it into your workspace.

Next, open your workspace by clicking the green *Open* button.

=== Editing the commands after importing a project

After you have a project in your workspace, you can add commands to it. Adding commands to your projects allows you to run, debug, or launch your application in a browser.

. To add commands to the project, open the workspace configuration in the *Dashboard*, then select the *Devfile* tab:
+
image::workspaces/workspace-config-yaml.png[Add commands to workspace]

. Open the workspace. 

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task...* from the main menu.
+

. To configure commands, select *Terminal* > *Configure Tasks...* from the main menu.

== Importing to a running workspace using the *Git: Clone...* command

. Start a workspace, then use the *Git: Clone...* command from the command palette or the Welcome screen to import a project to a running workspace.
+
image::workspaces/welcome.png[Welcome screen]

. Open the command palette with `F1` or `CTRL-SHIFT-P`, or from the link in the Welcome screen.

. Enter the path to the project you want to clone.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal"]
== Importing to a running workspace with `git clone` in a terminal

In addition to the approaches above, you can also start a workspace, open a *Terminal*, and type `git clone` to pull code.

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update workspace configuration, and the change is not reflected in the *Project* and *Devfile* tabs in the dashboard.

Similarly, if you add a project via the *Dashboard*, then delete it with `rm -fr myproject`, it may still appear in the *Projects* or *Devfile* tab.
