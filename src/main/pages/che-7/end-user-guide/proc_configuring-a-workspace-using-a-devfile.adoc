= Configuring a workspace using a devfile

This section describes how to select a workspace, loading in the required stack and a sample project, all in one step.

See the link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile[Devfile specifications] for detailed information on how to add or remove components, or how to set memory and environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* You need an OKD, OCP, or OSD cluster, if using Che on Openshift. See below for use of link:https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift] (OKD).

* Or, you can use a Kubernetes cluster such as link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[Minikube].

* To install on Minishift or Minikube, see link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[Deploying Che using chectl].

.Procedure

== Importing a project using a devfile

Stacks are defined as link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[devfiles]. This gives the user more flexibility when defining the project(s), IDE, commands, tools, and application runtimes needed in their workspace.

NOTE: In Che 6, a stack is defined with a Dockerfile. In Che 7, `devfile.yaml` is used instead.

== The minimal devfile

The following is the minimum content required in a `devfile.yaml` file:

* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#apiversion[apiVersion]
* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#metadata[metadata name]
* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#projects[projects name and source]

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: che-in-che-out
projects:
  - name: che
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/eclipse/che.git'
----

For a complete `devfile` example file, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[Eclipse Che in Che devfile.yaml].


== Creating a workspace from a devfile

To create a workspace from a devfile:

. Commit a `devfile.yaml` file into the root of your git repo.

. When the repository contains a `devfile.yaml` file, point a running Che 7 instance at that link:https://github.com/eclipse/che[project], and it will use the discovered link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml] file to build a workspace using the `/f?url=` API.

* For example, when using link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[Che inside Minishift]: `++http://che-che.<IP-address>.nip.io/f?url=https://github.com/eclipse/che++`.

. You can also point at a plain text file: `++http://che-che.<IP-address>.nip.io/f?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nickboldt/9551284c2c779a93ccf16bc801416205/raw/7ad1e949880d7f8ed30360e74bb9f8426450db05/devfile.yaml++`.

. If you are familiar with link:https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl/[chectl], you can also reference a local devfile. For example, to create a workspace in which to build the Che project:
+
* First link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[deploy Che onto Minishift] (or another cluster).
+
* Next, fetch the devfile and run the `chectl` command to start a workspace called *che-in-che* from the devfile in the Minishift `che-che` instance.
+
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/devfile.yaml -o /tmp/devfile.yaml

$ ./chectl workspace:start -f /tmp/devfile.yaml -n che-che
  ✔ Retrieving Che Server URL...http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io
  ✔ Verify if Che server is running
  ✔ Create workspace from Devfile /tmp/devfile.yaml

Workspace IDE URL:
http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io/dashboard/#/ide/che/che-in-che
