A factory is a template containing configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier added to the IDE URL. Factories can be used to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces.

Factories are URLs for sharing with others. Factories generate new workspaces in the account of the developer who loaded the factory, including cloned projects and ready-to-go commands. Factories are wrapped with policies, so that a factory owner can control when, how, and who is able to make use of the factory.
