= Sharing your Che-Theia plug-in with a factory

A Che-Theia factory can be used to share a plug-in in development environment with other people. This section describes how to do it.

== Sharing a factory with a plug-in development environment

This approach brings an advantage: other people can and contribute to the development -- provided they have write access to the repository with the plug-in.

Create a factory with the plug-in development environment, and share it. Reviewers get exactly the same environment and need to build and run the plug-in to test it (a script or instructions on how to build should be included in the plug-in repository).

The reviewer needs to start a hosted plug-in instance and specify the path to the plug-in project inside the workspace. See xref:testing-che-theia-plug-ins_extending-che[] for instructions on how to start a hosted instance of Che-Theia for plug-in testing.

To make reviewers' work easier, it is possible to invoke a command to build the plug-in after factory load finishes. For more details, see factory documentation (link:link[TODO LINK]).

== Sharing a factory with plug-in configuration

This method provides a workspace with a ready-to-use plug-in. The author of the plug-in needs to host the plug-in binaries in a custom registry (link:link[TODO LINK]).

. Create a factory.
. Go to the factory details, and scroll to the *Configuration* section.
. Add the plug-in into the `workspace.attributes.plugins` field. The format is the same as described in xref:adding-a-che-theia-plug-in-into-a-workspace_publishing-che-theia-plug-ins[].

. Share the factory link.

WARNING: Accept only factories from trusted sources. Malicious factories could steal data accessible from within your workspace.
