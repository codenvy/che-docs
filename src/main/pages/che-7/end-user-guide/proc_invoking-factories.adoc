= Invoking factories

NOTE: Try a factory by cloning a public workspace on `che.openshift.io`: link:https://che.openshift.io/f?id=factorymtyoro1y0qt8tq2j[try a factory].

Factories can be invoked from a factory URL built in multiple ways. You can replace the `localhost:8080` domain with the hostname of any Che installation.

Using factories on `che.openshift.io` requires the user to be authenticated. Users who are not authenticated see a login screen after they click on the factory URL. Users without an account can create one using the same dialog.

Once a factory is executed, it either loads an existing workspace or generates a new one, depending on the factory configuration. The name of the workspace is determined by the factory configuration, and its name becomes a part of the URL used to access the factory. The format is: `{hostname}/{username}/{workspace}`.
