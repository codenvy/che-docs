Eclipse Che is an extensible and customizable developer-workspaces platform.

There are three different ways to extend Eclipse Che:

* *Alternative IDEs* allow to provide specialized tooling within Eclipse Che. For example, a Jupyter notebook for a data analyst. Alternate IDEs can be based on Eclipse Theia or any other web IDE. The default IDE in Eclipse Che is Che-Theia.

* *Che-Theia plug-ins* add capabilities to the Che-Theia IDE. They rely on plug-in APIs that are compatible with Visual Studio Code. The plug-ins are isolated from the IDE. They can be packaged as files or as containers to provide their own dependencies.

* *Stacks* are pre-configured Che workspaces with dedicated set of tools, which cover different developer personas. For example, it is possible to pre-configure a workbench for a tester with only the tools needed for their purposes.

Extending Eclipse Che can be done entirely using Eclipse Che. Starting with version 7, Eclipse Che provides a self-hosting mode.
