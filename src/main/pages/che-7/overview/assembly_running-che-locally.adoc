= Running {prod-short} locally

:context: running-che-locally

This section contains instructions for deploying and running {prod} locally, on a personal workstation.

.Prerequisites

To run and manage {prod-short}:

* A Kubernetes, version 1.9 or higher, or OpenShift cluster to deploy {prod-short} on
* The link:https://github.com/che-incubator/{prod-cli}[`{prod-cli}`] command-line tool for managing a {prod-short} server and its development workspaces. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/installing-the-{prod-cli}-management-tool/[Installing the `{prod-cli}` management tool].

{prod} is available in two modes:
* Kubernetes (version 1.9 or higher) or OpenShift cluster (version 3.11 or higher) to deploy {prod-short} on
* *Single-user*: Non-authenticated {prod-short}, lighter and suited for personal desktop environments
* *Multi-user*: Authenticted {prod-short}, suited for the cloud, for organizations and developer teams

// TODO: See link:single-multi-user.html[Single and Multi-User {prod-short}] to learn more.

This section describes how to deploy and run {prod-short} in *single-user* mode.
