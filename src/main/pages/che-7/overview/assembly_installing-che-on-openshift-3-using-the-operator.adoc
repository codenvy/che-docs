:context: installing-{prod-id-short}-on-openshift-3-using-the-operator

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application which also provide the following:

* Repeatability of installation and upgrade.

* Constant health checks of every system component.

* Over-the-air (OTA) updates for OpenShift components and independent software vendor (ISV) content.

* A place to encapsulate knowledge from field engineers and spread it to all users.

This chapter describes how to install {prod-short} on OpenShift 3, with the CLI management tool, using the Operator method.
