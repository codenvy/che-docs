== Permission denied errors when installing {prod} in the default namespace

When installing {prod} in the `default` namespace, the proper security contexts and file permissions are not set appropriately, causing the installation to fail.  Users should avoid installing {prod} in the `default` namespace and instead create a new namespace, for example, `che`, to contain the {prod} installation.

== Workspace startup failures when StorageClass configured with `volumeBindingMode` set to `WaitForFirstConsumer` on Openshift < 4.2

When Che is installed on Openshift version less than 4.2, and StorageClass is configured with `volumeBindingMode` property set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`, workspaces may fail to start with `Unrecoverable event occured: 'FailedScheduling'` message.
Possible workarounds is to reconfigure Che and remove `FailedScheduling` from the `che.infra.kubernetes.workspace_unrecoverable_events` property value (inside che.properties file or deployment config) or upgrate Openshift installation to version 4.2 or greater.
