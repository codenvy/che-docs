= Installing {prod-short} on OpenShift 4 using OperatorHub

:context: installing-{prod-id-short}-on-openshift-4-using-operatorhub

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application which also provide the following:

* Repeatability of installation and upgrade.

* Constant health checks of every system component.

* Over-the-air (OTA) updates for OpenShift components and independent software vendor (ISV) content.

* A place to encapsulate knowledge from field engineers and spread it to all users.

On OpenShift, {prod} can be installed using the OperatorHub Catalog present in the OpenShift web console.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use the `{prod-cli}` utility script for deploying {prod-short} on {ocp} and {osd} versions {oc4-ver}. This method is considered unofficial and serves as a backup installation method for situations where the installation method using OperatorHub is not available.

For information about how to use the `{prod-cli}` utility script for deploying {prod-short} on OpenShift, see the
{link-installing-on-openShift-3-using-the-operator} section.
