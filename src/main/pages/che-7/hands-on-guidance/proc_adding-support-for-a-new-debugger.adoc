== Prerequisites

* Install the latest Che-Theia plug-in Yeoman generator by running:
+
----
$ npm install -g yo @theia/generator-plugin
----

== Procedure

. Generate a sample by running `yo @theia/plugin`. When prompted, confirm the choices for *Backend plug-in*, *Samples*, and then *Debugger sample*. This creates a project and a ready-to-use plug-in, which can be deployed.

. Replace the mock implementation of the debug adapter in the `src/vscode-mockDebug.ts` and `src/vscode-mockRuntime.ts` files by code that interacts with a real debugger or runtime.

. Build the plug-in by running `yarn` in the root of the project.

. Deploy the Che-Theia plug-in via the plugin-in registry.
