+
----
$ npm install -g yo @theia/generator-plugin
----

== Procedure

. Generate sample by running `yo @theia/plugin`. When prompted confirm choices for “Backend plug-in”, “Samples” and then “Debugger sample”. It will create a project and a ready-to-use plugin which can be deployed.

. Replace the mock implementation of the debug adapter in `src/vscode-mockDebug.ts` and `src/vscode-mockRuntime.ts` by some code that talks to a "real" debugger or runtime.

. Build the plugin by running `yarn` in the root of the project.

. Deploy Che Theia plugin via Che plugin-in registry.
