= Connecting source code from GitHub to an OpenShift Component using OpenShift Connector

When the user has a Git-stored source code that is wanted for further development, it is more efficient to deploy it directly from the Git repository into the OpenShift Connector Component.

This chapter describes how to obtain the content from the Git repository and connect it with a {prod-short}-developed OpenShift Component.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running  {prod-short} workspace.
* Be logged in to the OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift Connector.

.Procedure

To make changes to your GitHub component, clone the repository into {prod-short} to obtain this source code:

. In the {prod-short} main screen, open the *Command Palette* by pressing kbd:[F1].
. Type the `Git Clone` command in the *Command Palette* and press kbd:[Enter].
. Provide the GitHub URL and select the destination for the deployment.
. Add source-code files to your Project by clicking the btn:[Add to workspace] button.

For additional information about cloning Git repository, see: {link-accessing-a-git-repository-via-https_version}.

.Additional resources
* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing procedure modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
