= Authenticating with OpenShift Connector from {prod-short}

Before the user can develop and push Components from {prod-short}, they need to authenticate with an OpenShift cluster.

OpenShift Connector offers the following methods for logging in to the OpenShift Cluster from the {prod-short} instance:

* Using the notification that asks to log in to the OpenShift cluster where {prod-short} is deployed to.
* Using the btn:[Log in to the cluster] button.
* Using the Command Palette.

[NOTE]
====
.In {prod-short} {prod-ver}, Openshift Connector plug-in requires manual connecting to the target cluster

By default, the Openshift Connector plug-in logs into the cluster as `inClusterUser`, which may not have the manage project permission. This causes an error message to be displayed when a new project is being created using Openshift Application Explorer:
----
Failed to create Project with error 'Error: Command failed: "/tmp/vscode-unpacked/redhat.vscode-openshift -connector.latest.qvkozqtkba.openshift-connector-0.1.4-523.vsix/extension/out/tools/linux/odo" project create test-project ✗ projectrequests.project.openshift.io is forbidden
----

To work around this temporary issue, log out from the local cluster and relog in to OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift user's credentials.
====

When using a local instance of OpenShift (such as CodeReady Containers or Minishift), the user’s credentials are stored in the workspace `~/.kube/config` file, and may be used for automatic authentication in subsequent logins. In the context of {prod-short}, the `~/.kube/config` is stored as a part of the plug-in sidecar container.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} quick-starts].
* A {prod-short} workspace has been created.
* The OpenShift Connector plug-in is installed.
* The OpenShift OAuth provider is configured (only for the auto-login to the OpenShift cluster where {prod-short} is deployed. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-openshift-oauth/[Configuring OpenShift OAuth]).

.Procedure

. In the left panel, select the *OpenShift Application Explorer* icon.
+
The OpenShift Connector panel is displayed.
. Log in using the OpenShift Application Explorer. Use one of the following methods:
** Click the btn:[Log in to cluster] button in the top left corner of the pane.
** Press kbd:[F1] to open the Command Palette, or navigate to *View -> Find Command* in the top menu.
+
Search for *OpenShift: Log in to cluster* and press kbd:[Enter].
. If a *You are already logged in a cluster.* message appears, click *Yes*.
+
A selection whether to log in using *Credentials* or *Token* is displayed at the top of the screen.
. Select the method to log in to the cluster and follow the login instructions.
+
NOTE: For authenticating with a token, the required token information is in the top right corner of the main {ocp} screen, under *__<User name>__ -> Copy Login Command*.

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing procedure modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
