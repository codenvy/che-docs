= Configuring storage types

{prod} supports three types of storage with different capabilities:

* Persistent
* Ephemeral
* Asynchronous


== Persistent storage

Persistent storage allows storing user changes directly in the mounted Persistent Volume. User changes are kept safe by the {kubernetes-or-openshift} infrastructure (storage backend) at the cost of slow I/O, especially with many small files. For example, Node.js projects tend to have many dependencies and the `node_modules/` directory is filled with thousands of small files.

NOTE: I/O speeds vary depending on the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[Storage Classes] configured in the environment.

Persistent storage is the default mode for new workspaces. To make this setting visible in workspace configuration, add the following to the devfile:

[source,yaml]
----
attributes:
 persistVolumes: 'true'
----


== Ephemeral storage

Ephemeral storage saves files to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir[`emptyDir`] volume. This volume is initially empty. When a Pod is removed from a node, the data in the `emptyDir` volume is deleted forever. This means that all changes are lost on workspace stop or restart.

IMPORTANT: To save the changes, commit and push to the remote before stopping an ephemeral workspace.

Ephemeral mode provides faster I/O than persistent storage. To enable this storage type, add the following to workspace configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
attributes:
 persistVolumes: 'false'
----

== Asynchronous storage

NOTE: Asynchronous storage is an experimental feature.

Asynchronous storage is a combination of persistent and ephemeral modes. The initial workspace container mounts the `emptyDir` volume. Then a backup is performed on workspace stop, and changes are restored on workspace start. Asynchronous storage provides fast I/O (similar to ephemeral mode), and workspace project changes are persisted.

Synchronization is performed by the link:https://rsync.samba.org/[rsync] tool using the link:https://www.openssh.com/[SSH] protocol. When a workspace is configured with asynchronous storage, the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/workspace-data-sync/[workspace-data-sync] plug-in is automatically added to the workspace configuration. The plug-in runs the `rsync` command on workspace start to restore changes. When a workspace is stopped, it sends changes to the permanent storage.

For relatively small projects, the restore procedure is fast, and project source files are immediately available after Che-Theia is initialized. In case `rsync` takes longer, the synchronization process is shown in the Che-Theia status-bar area. (link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/tree/master/extensions/eclipse-che-theia-file-sync-tracker[Extension in Che-Theia repository]).

[NOTE]
====
Asynchronous mode has the following limitations:

* Supports only the _common_ PVC strategy
* Supports only the _per-user_ {orch-namespace} strategy
* Only one workspace can be running at a time
====

To configure asynchronous storage for a workspace, add the following to workspace configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
attributes:
 asyncPersist: 'true'
 persistVolumes: 'false'
----

== Configuring storage type defaults for {prod-short} dashboard

Use the fo;llowing two `che.properties` to configure the default client values in {prod-short} dashboard:

`che.workspace.storage.available_types`:: Defines available values for storage types that clients like the dashboard propose for users during workspace creation or update. Available values: `persistent`, `ephemeral`, and `async`. Separate multiple values by commas. For example:
+
----
che.workspace.storage.available_types=persistent,ephemeral,async
----

`che.workspace.storage.preferred_type`:: Defines the default value for storage type that clients like the dashboard propose for users during workspace creation or update. The `async` value is not recommended as the default type because it is experimental. For example:
+
----
che.workspace.storage.preferred_type=persistent
----

The *Storage Type* drop-down menu is available on the *Create Custom Workspace* page of the user dashboard:

image::workspaces/create-custom-ws-storage-type.png[link="{imagesdir}/workspaces/create-custom-ws-storage-type.png"]


== Idling asynchronous storage Pods

{prod-short} can shut down the Asynchronous Storage Pod when not used for a configured period of time.

Use these configuration properties to adjust the behavior:

`che.infra.kubernetes.async.storage.shutdown_timeout_min`:: Defines the idle time after which the asynchronous storage Pod is stopped following the stopping of the last active workspace. The default value is 120 minutes.

`che.infra.kubernetes.async.storage.shutdown_check_period_min`:: Defines the frequency with which the asynchronous storage Pod is checked for idleness. The default value is 30 minutes.
