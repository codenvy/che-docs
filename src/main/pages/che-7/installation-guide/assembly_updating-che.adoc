== Known issues

=== Upgrading from Che 6

If you installed Che 6 using the operator, you might have to do a couple of adjustments after the upgrade of
the operator. Upon its upgrade the operator ventures on updating Che server and other components of
the installation to the versions defined by the operator. Because of the change in how such upgrades are handled
between Che 6 and Che 7 operator, this might result in some components being stuck in their old versions.

To resolve this situation, it is necessary to manually update the images mentioned in the `checluster` custom resource
describing the Che installation. To reset the images to their default versions for given operator version, it is enough
to set the image properties to empty string. This will make Che operator use the default versions it was built with.
Namely, it might be necessary to review the following components:

|===
| Component | CR attribute name 
| Postgresql | `spec.database.postgresImage` 
| Keycloak | `spec.auth.identityProviderImage` 
| PVC Jobs | `spec.storage.pvcJobsImage`
|===

=== Updating Che installation using the operator

When making changes to the `checluster` custom resource, make sure to use patching to make updates to it, e. g.:

```
kubectl patch checluster my-che --type=json -n che-namespace -p '...'
```

or

```
oc patch checluster my-che --type=json -n che-namespace -p '...'
```

WARNING: Making local updates to the YAML file of the `checluster` resource and then applying such changed resource to
the cluster using `kubectl apply -f` or `oc apply -f` can result in invalidation of the Che installation.
