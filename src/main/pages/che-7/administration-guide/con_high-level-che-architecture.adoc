At a high-level, {prod-short} is composed of one central workspace controller that manages the {prod-short} workspaces through the Kubernetes API.

When {prod-short} is installed on a Kubernetes cluster, the workspace controller is the only component that is deployed. A {prod-short} workspace is created immediately after a user requests it.

This section describes the different services that create the workspaces controller and the {prod-short} workspaces.
