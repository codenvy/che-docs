This section describes how to view the plug-in broker logs.

The `che-plugin-broker` Pod itself is deleted when its work is complete. Therefore, its event logs are only available while the workspace is starting.

.Procedure

To see logged events from temporary Pods:

. Start a {prod-short} workspace.

. From the main {ocp} screen, go to *Workload -> Pods*.

. Use the OpenShift terminal console located in the Pod's *Terminal* tab

.Verification step
* OpenShift terminal console displays the plug-in broker logs while the workspace is starting
