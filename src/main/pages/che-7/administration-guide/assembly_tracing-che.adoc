:context: tracing-che

Tracing helps gather timing data to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It helps to understand a complete transaction or workflow as it propagates through a distributed system. Every transaction may reflect performance anomalies in an early phase when new services are being introduced by independent teams.

Tracing the Che application may help analyse the execution of various operations (such as workspace creation, workspace startup) by breaking down the duration of the sub-operation executions. It also helps in finding bottlenecks and, in turn, improving the overall state of the platform.

Tracers live in applications. They record the timing and metadata of operations. They often instrument libraries, so that their use is transparent to users. For example, an instrumented web server records the time when it received a request and when it sent a response. The trace data collected is called a *span*. A span has a context that contains information such as trace and span identifiers and other kinds of data that can be propagated.

== Tracing API

Che utilizes Opentracing API - a vendor-neutral framework for instrumentation. This means that if a developer wants to try a different tracing backend, then instead of repeating the whole instrumentation process for the new distributed tracing system, the developer can simply change the configuration of the tracer backend.

== Tracing backend

By default, Che uses Jaeger as the tracing backend. Jaeger was inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, and it is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. Jaeger extends a more complex architecture for a larger scale of requests and performance.
