= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

This section describes how to use the Prometheus monitoring system to collect, store and query metrics about {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is exposing metrics on port `8087`. See xref:enabling-and-exposing-{prod-id-short}-metrics_{context}[].

* Prometheus 2.9.1 or above is running. Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding *service* and *route*. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure



* Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port

.Prometheus configuration example

There are two blocks of configuration in the `prometheus-config.yml` block of the example configuration file: `global` and `scrape_configs`.
+
The `global` block controls the Prometheus server's global configuration. We have two options present. The first, `scrape_interval`, controls how often Prometheus will scrape targets. You can override this for individual targets. In this case the global setting is to scrape every 5 seconds. The `evaluation_interval` option controls how often Prometheus will evaluate rules. Prometheus uses rules to create new time series and to generate alerts. This option is not used in the example here.
+
The last block, `scrape_configs`, controls what resources Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration there is a single job, called `{prod-host}`, which scrapes the time series data exposed by the {prod-short} server. The job contains a single, statically configured, target, the `{prod-host}` host on port `8087`.

.Verification steps

* Use the Prometheus console to query and view metrics.
