= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

This section describes how to use the Prometheus monitoring system to collect, store and query metrics about {prod-short}.

.Procedure

. Install Prometheus 2.9.1 or above. See more link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/].

. Set the `CHE_METRICS_ENABLED=true` environment variable

. Expose the `8087` port as a service on the che-master host

. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port

----
- apiVersion: v1
  data:
    prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval:     5s           <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s           <2>
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'che'
          static_configs:

<1> rate, at which a target is scraped
<2> rate, at which recording and alerting rules are re-checked (not used in our system at the moment)
<3> scrape metrics from the `8087` port

.Verification steps

. Navigate to the Prometheus console accessible at the `9090` port of the application pod: `++http://++{prod-host}:9090/`. The default template provides an existing *service* and a *route* to access it. 

. Use the Prometheus console to query and view metrics.
