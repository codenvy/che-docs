= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

This section describes how to use the Prometheus monitoring system to collect, store and query metrics about {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is exposing metrics on port `8087`. See xref:enabling-and-exposing-{prod-id-short}-metrics_{context}[].

* Prometheus 2.9.1 or above is running. Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding *service* and *route*. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

* Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port

<1> rate, at which a target is scraped
<2> rate, at which recording and alerting rules are re-checked (not used in our system at the moment)
<3> scrape metrics from the `8087` port

.Verification steps

* Use the Prometheus console to query and view metrics.
