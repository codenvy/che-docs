= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects metrics in real time and stores them in a time series database.

Prometheus comes with a console accessible at the `9090` port of the application pod. By default, a template provides an existing *service* and a *route* to access it. It can be used to query and view metrics.

== Prometheus terminology

Prometheus offers:

counter:: the simplest numerical type of metric whose value can be only increased. A typical example is counting the amount of HTTP requests that go through the system.

gauge:: numerical value that can be increased or decreased. Best suited for representing values of objects.

histogram:: a more complex metric that is suited for performing observations. Metrics are collected and grouped in configurable buckets, which allwos to present the results, for instance, in a form of a heatmap.
