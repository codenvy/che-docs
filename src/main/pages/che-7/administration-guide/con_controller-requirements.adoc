= Controller Requirements

The Workspace Controller consists of a set of 5 services running in 5 distinct containers. The following table presents the default compute resources requirements of each of these services.

These default values work fine when the {prod-short} Workspace Controller manages a small amount of {prod-short} workspaces. For bigger deployments, increase the Memory Limit. Refer to the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/advanced-configuration-options[Advanced Configurations Options] article to see how the default requests and limits can be overridden. As an example, for the hosted version of Che that runs link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io], we use 4Gi.
