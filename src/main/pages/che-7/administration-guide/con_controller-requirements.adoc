[id="controller-requirements_{context}"]
= Controller Requirements

The Workspace Controller is composed of 5 services running in 5 distinct containers. The default compute resources requirements of these 5 services are reported in the following table:

[cols="2,2,1,1", options="header"] 
.ControllerServices
|===
|Pod
|Container Name
|Default Memory Limit
|Default Memory Request

|{prod-short}
|che
|1Gi
|512Mi

|Postgres
|postgres
|1Gi
|512Mi

|Keycloak
|keycloak
|2Gi
|512Mi

|Devfile Registry
|che-devfile-registry
|256Mi
|16Mi

|Plugin Registry
|che-plugin-registry
|256Mi
|16Mi
|===

These default values work fine when the {prod-short} Workspace Controller manages a small amount of {prod-short} workspaces. For bigger deployments the Memory Limit should be increased. Refer to the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/advanced-configuration-options[Advanced Configurations Options] article to see how the default requests and limits can be overridden. As an example, for the hosted version of Che that runs link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io], we use 4Gi.
