= {prod-short} Architectural Components

As illustrated in the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/high-level-che-architecture[High Level {prod-short} Architecture] article, {prod} is composed by:

* A central workspace controller: an always up service that manages users workspaces
* Users workspaces: container based IDEs that are stopped when the user stops coding

Both the {prod-short} central controller and user workspaces are composed of multiple containers. Those containers contribute to the resources consumption in terms of CPU/RAM limit and CPU/RAM request. For a detailed explanation of how containers compute resources requests and limits are managed by Kubernetes refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/[Kubernetes Documentation].
