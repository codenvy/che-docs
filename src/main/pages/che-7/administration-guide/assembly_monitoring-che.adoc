{prod-short} can expose certain data as metrics, that can be processed by Prometheus
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
and Grafana stack
endif::[]
. 

Prometheus is a monitoring system, that maintains the collection of metrics - time series key-value data which can represent consumption of resources like CPU and memory, amount of processed HTTP queries and their execution time, and {prod-short} specific resources, such as number of users and workspaces, the start and shutdown of workspaces, information about JsonRPC stack.

Prometheus is powered with a special query language, that allows manipulating the collected data, and perform various binary, vector and aggregation operations with it, to help create a more refined view on data.

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
Grafana offers a front-end "facade" with tools to create a various visual representation in the form of dashboards with various panels and graph types.

Note that this monitoring stack is not an official production-ready solution, but rather has an introduction purpose.

== Enabling {prod-short} metrics collections

[id='prerequisites-{context}',discrete]
.Prerequisites

* Installed Prometheus 2.9.1 or above. See more link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/].
* Installed Grafana 6.0 or above. See more at link:https://grafana.com/docs/installation/[https://grafana.com/docs/installation/]

.Procedure

. Set the `CHE_METRICS_ENABLED=true` environment variable
. Expose the `8087` port as a service on the che-master host
. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port
. Configure a Prometheus data source on Grafana
. Deploy {prod-short}-specific dashboards on Grafana
