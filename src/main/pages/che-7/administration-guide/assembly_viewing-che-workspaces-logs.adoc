This section describes how to view {prod-short} workspaces logs.

[NOTE]
====
.Mention about nonpersistent plug-in broker logs:

The `che-plugin-broker` Pod itself is deleted when its work is complete. Therefore, its event logs are only available while the workspace is starting. To see logged events from temporary Pods, use the OpenShift terminal console located in the Pod's *Terminal* tab, accessible from the *Workload -> Pods* menu of the main {ocp} screen.
