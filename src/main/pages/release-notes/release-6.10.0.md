## Release Details

### Secure Servers (#ISSUE)
Eclipse Che extension developers might be interested in a new feature - "Secure Servers"
It can be useful if you want to protect your web-based tool, that running as part of a workspace with Che authentification.

Example:
```json
"tooling": {
    "port": "4921",
    "protocol": "http",
    "attributes": {
        "secure": "true",
        "unsecuredPaths": "/liveness",
        "cookiesAuthEnabled": "true"
    }
}
```
For an example, take a look at the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or0CWHAVR4Q).
