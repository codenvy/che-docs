[id="authorization-and-user-management"]
== Authorization and user management

Eclipse Che uses http://www.Keycloak.org[Keycloak] to create, import, manage, delete, and authenticate users.  Keycloak uses built-in authentication mechanisms and user storage.  It can use a third-party identity management systems to create and authenticate users. Eclipse Che requires a Keycloak token when you request access to Che resources.

Local users and imported federation users must have an email address in their profile.

The default Keycloak credentials are `admin:admin`. You can use the `admin:admin` credentials when logging into Che for the first time. It has system privileges. 

If Che is deployed on Openshift, go to your Keycloak URL to find:

* OpenShift web console > keycloak namespace 

If Che is running on Docker:
 
* Go to `$CHE_HOST:5050/auth`   

[id="configuring-che-to-work-with-keycloak"]
== Configuring Che to work with Keycloak

The deployment script ensures that Keycloak is properly configured when Che is deployed on OpenShift or installed on Docker. When the `che-public` client is created, the following fields are populated:

* *Valid Redirect URIs*: Use this URL to access Che. 
* *Web Origins*:

Common errors: 

*Invalid `redirectURI` error*:  occurs when you access Che at `myhost`, which is an alias, and your 
original `CHE_HOST` is `1.1.1.1`.  If this error occurs, go to the Keycloak administration console and the valid redirect URIs are configured.

*CORS error*: occurs when you have an invalid web origin

[id="setting-up-user-federation"]
== Setting up user federation

Keycloak federates external user databases and supports LDAP and Active Directory. You can test the connection and authenticate users before choosing a storage provider.

See http://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.2/server_admin/topics/user-federation.html[user storage federation] to learn how to add a provider.

See http://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.2/server_admin/topics/user-federation/ldap.html[LDAP and Active Directory] to specify multiple LDAP servers.

[id="enabling-authentication-with-social-accounts-and-brokering"]
== Enabling authentication with social accounts and brokering

Keycloak provides built-in support for most common social networks such as GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, OpenShift. See Instructions to http://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.2/server_admin/topics/identity-broker/social/github.html[enable Login with GitHub].

You can also enable SSH key upload to Che users’ GitHub accounts. 

To enable this feature when you register a GitHub identity provider: 

. Set scope to `repo,user,write:public_key`.

. Set store tokens and stored tokens readable to *ON*.

. Add a default read-token role

This is default `delegated` OAuth service mode for Multi-User Che, which is configured with property `che.oauth.service_mode`.

Setting it to `embedded` will make it use Che’s OAuth Authenticator, for which link:version-control.html#github-oauth[Instructions for Single User mode] will apply.
