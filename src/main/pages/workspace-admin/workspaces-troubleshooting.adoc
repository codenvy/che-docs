Failures to start a workspace may be caused by different factors:

1.  Environment recipe
2.  Network conditions

[id="bad-recipes"]
== Bad Recipes

When a workspace is being started, environment link:recipes.html[recipe] is sent to Docker or OpenShift API. Che server then listens to events provided by a particular infrastructure. In simple words, Che server expects a running container (Docker) or pod (OpenShift). If the infrastructure was unable to create and start a container/pod from the provided recipe, Che server fails to start an environment, and consequently workspace start fails.

A recipe can be *"bad"* due to the following reasons:

1.  Docker build fails with the provided Dockerfile. Maybe it is just a broken Dockerfile or it can partially be Che fault. Docker build in Che link:recipes.html#dockerfile[does not support context]. If this is the case, consider playing with a Docker recipe locally to make sure it’s a valid Dockerfile. If you need to ADD or COPY resources into an image, do it on your local machine, push the image to a registry (say, DockerHub), and use the resulting images in the recipe.
2.  Che does not support certain link:recipes.html#composefile[Docker Compose syntax]. Make sure your composefile is "Che friendly".
3.  Timeouts. If you install packages in your Dockerfile instructions it can take time. Moreover, in this case you depend on network conditions

If a workspace start fails because the container/pod was never launched, you will not see logs from link:installers.html[installers]. Usually, you will find logs from infrastructure, image pull, build etc. Make sure you analyze those logs to find the problem. Che server in its turn will also produce logs that can be very helpful in debugging the problem.

[id="network-conditions"]
== Network Conditions

There’s a lot of communication between Che server, agents running in a workspace container/pod and user’s browser. Firewall, filtered ports and other network restrictions may cause troubles when starting a workspace.

A workspace is considered to be in a `RUNNING` state after Che server was able to verify that the workspace agent is up. Workspace agent, in its turn, also tries to reach Che server. It all happens in separate containers/pods, and user’s browser is not yet involved (you may start a workspace using REST API for example). So, if Che server logs say that `workspace started by user $userName` it means that the workspace container/pod is up, the workspace agent has successfully started and Che server is able to reach it.

However, it may happen that your browser (the client) cannot connect to a workspace agent. Che server may use an internal IP to reach workspace agent, while you may access a workspace from a machine that is located in a different network. If you see a message saying that IDE cannot be initialized, open browser dev console and take a look at failed requests (there should be a few to /project and project-type API). Odds are that the ephemeral port range is filtered in your network.

[id="bootstrapping-failures"]
== Bootstrapping Failures

When a workspace starts, Che server creates and starts a container/pod or a set of containers/pods as per environment recipe. Once the container/pod is running, a bootstrapping process begins - bootstrapper binary is downloaded and launched. If you see something about bootstrapping failures in server logs, and/or don’t see any output in machine tab in a workspace view, odds are that bootstrapper has been never downloaded. There can be several reasons for that:

* network conditions (for example, running firewalld).
* bad bootstrapper binary URL that Che server uses (often reproduced when deploying to OpenShift and missing must have envs)

You may try to manually download bootstrapper binary. When on OpenShift, get a shell into the pod (rsh or terminal in web console) and run:

----
cd /tmp/bootstrapper
ls -la  # to check if there's a bootstrapper binary
curl ${CHE_URL}/agent-binaries/linux_amd64/bootstrapper/bootstrapper
----

If this curl fails, something in your network blocks port 80, or 443 (if you use https routes on OpenShift).
