== What Are Stacks

A stack is a template of link:workspace-data-model.html[workspace configuration] and some meta-information like scope, tags, components, description, name and ID. Stacks are used by User Dashboard to make it easy to create workspaces and well as filter sample projects compatible with a chosen stack.

Stacks are displayed in User Dashboard on Create a workspace page. You can filter them by type (single vs multi machine), scope (the ones displayed by default vs others), as well as search for a stack by keyword.

== How Stacks Are Used?

As stacks are workspace templates, they are used to create workspace when in User Dashboard. See: link:creating-starting-workspaces.html[User Guide: Creating and Starting Workspaces].

[id="community-supported-stacks"]
== Community Supported Stacks

The list of stacks Che offers out of the box references tested stacks and sample applications with commands on how to build, run and debug them. There are also stacks contributed by the community which work fine with Che but do not go through daily tests. It is possible however that sample applications may be incompatible with certain stacks.

Community supported stacks and sample apps (if any) are located in https://github.com/che-samples/community-stacks[Community stacks GitHub repo].

Each directory has `${technology}-stack.json` and `${technology}-samples.json`. If you want to import a chosen stack, follow the below instructions:

1.  Copy content of a chosen json
2.  Go to `${CHE_HOST}/swagger/#!/stack/createStack`, paste JSON content to request body field
3.  Hit *Try it out* button.

If there’s a conflict with stack ID or name, use a different name or ID (make sure it is unique).

For a multi-user setup, you may want to make your stack available for a particular user or all users in the system. If this is the case, see link:#stack-sharing-and-system-stacks[stack sharing].

To import *sample applications*, move chosen `*-stacks.json` files to:

* `${LOCAL_STORAGE}/instance/data/templates` for Docker infra
* `${mount-path-of-che-data-volume}/templates` for OpenShift/K8S infra. You will need admin privileges to get PV details (host path) and access to host directory. Also, make sure the new jsons have the same permissions as the original `samples.json` that you will find there.

You can find Dockerfiles for all stacks in https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles[Che Dockerfiles repository].

[id="stack-sharing-and-system-stacks"]
== Stack Sharing and System Stacks

Stacks that a user creates are available only for this user. Che users with system privileges can share created stacks with selected users or all users in the system. Currently, there are no UI controls for that, so a couple of REST calls need to be made:

* Log in as admin
* Find your stack ID: go to `/swagger/#!/stack/searchStacks` to get a list of all stacks (you may filter search by tags). Find your stack my name and get its ID.
* The next API to use is: `/swagger/#!/permissions`
* Find the below POST method:

image::workspaces/stack_permissions.png[]

* use the following JSON (replace `${STACK_ID}` with an actual ID)

[source,json]
----
{
"userId": "*",
  "domainId": "stack",
  "instanceId": "${STACK_ID}",
  "actions": [
    "read",
    "search"
  ]
}
----

If you get 204, all users in the system will be able to see this stack. If you want to share a stack with a particular user, get its ID and use it instead of `*` in JSON.

Similarly, an admin can remove permissions from stacks or remove out of the box stacks to replace them with custom ones. Stacks can be created wither in User Dashboard or using any REST client, for instance Swagger (`$CHE_HOST:$CHE_PORT/swagger`) bundled with Che.

[id="stacks-loading"]
== Stacks Loading

Stacks are loaded from a JSON file that is packaged into resources of a special component deployed with a workspace master. This JSON isn’t exposed to users and stack management is performed in User Dashboard (that uses REST API).

Stacks are loaded from a JSON file only when the database is initialized, i.e. when a user first stats Che. This is the default policy that can be changed. To keep getting updates with new Che stacks, set `pass:[CHE_PREDEFINED_STACKS_RELOAD__ON__START=true]` in `che.env`. When set to true, `stacks.json` will be used to update Che database, each time Che server starts. This means Che will get all stacks in stacks.json and upload them to a DB. This way, you may make sure that you keep existing custom stacks (user-created) and get stack updates from new Che releases. New and edited stacks (for example those with fixes in stack definition) will be merged in. Conflicts are possible though, since for example, if a new Che version provides a new stack with the name "My Cool Stack" and a stack with this name somehow exists in a database, such a stack won’t be saved to a DB.
