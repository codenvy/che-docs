## How It Works

You can configure deployment of Che on Kubernetes by editing env variables that are defined in [che-kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/modules/kubernetes/files/che-kubernetes.yaml) file. Once done, execute `kubectl --namespace=che apply -f che-kubernetes.yaml `. Che deployment will be updated which automatically triggers a new deployment. This page focuses on some of the envs. You can either look at [Docker configuration page][docker-config] or [che.env](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/manifests/che.env) file.

We use recreate strategy. When the initial Che pod is shut down, server forcefully stops all workspace pods. Users working in those workspace will see a notification that the workspace is not running anymore. It does not impact data persistence - all workspace project files mounted through PVCs.

## Namespace for Workspaces

You can instruct Che server in what namespace(s) to create workspace pods. There are two scenarios. By default, every new workspace pod is created in a new namespace which is dictated by the following env:

`CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=""`

You may have one common namespace for all workspace pods:

`CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE="che-workspaces"`

## Volumes

`CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_STRATEGY="unique"`

There are two [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) strategies:

* **unique** - each workspace volume gets own PVC.  This is the default strategy. When a workspace is deleted, associated PVCs are deleted as well. However, an associated PVs may not be recycled and tghus cannot be re-used for a new claim. See [k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#recycling).
* **common** - there is one PVC for all workspaces. When a PVC is shared with all workspaces, there's a special service pod that starts before workspace is created to create a subpath in the PV for this particular ws. When a workspace is deleted an associated subpath is deleted as well.

If a common strategy is set, it is impossible to run multiple workspaces simultaneously because of a default `ReadWriteOnce` [access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) for workspace PVCs.


## HTTPS Mode

Che on Kubernetes doesn't support HTTPS mode yet.

## Scalability

To be able to run more workspaces, [add more nodes to your Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#management). If the system is out of resources, workspace start will fail with an error message returned from Kubernetes (usually it's `no available nodes` kind of error).

## Debug Mode

If you want Che server to run in a debug mode set the following env before running the script (false by default):

`CHE_DEBUG_SERVER=true`

## Image Pull Policy

If you want to always have the latest nightly image or use own latest tags when developing and testing Che

`IMAGE_PULL_POLICY`

## Private Docker Registries

Refer to [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

## Che Server Logs

When Eclipse Che gets deployed to Kubernetes, a PVC `che-data-volume` is [created](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/modules/kubernetes/files/che-kubernetes.yaml#L26) and bound to a PV. Logs are persisted in a PV and can be retrieved in the following ways:

* `kubectl get log dc/che`
* `kubectl describe pvc che-data-claim`, find PV it is bound to, then `oc describe pv $pvName`, you will get a local path with logs directory. Be careful with permissions for that directory, since once changed, Che server wont be able to write to a file
* in Kubernetes web console, eclipse-che namespace, **pods > che-pod > logs**.
