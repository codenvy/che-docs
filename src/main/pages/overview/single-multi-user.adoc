Eclipse Che is available in two different modes: single-user and multi-user.

**Single-user Che**

If you plan to use Che on your local machine or want to evaluate the platform, start with single-user Che. The advantages for using single-user Che are:

* The command line interface pulls fewer images
* The user dashboard is quickly available (no login)

Single-user Che does not provide multi-tenancy nor permissions for entities such as workspaces. Che server and workspaces are not secure with single-user Che. 

The following links have more information on installation:

* To install Che in the single-user mode on Docker, see link:docker-single-user[Single-user on Docker] 

* To install Che in the single-user mode on OpenShift, see link:openshift-single-user[Single-user on OpenShift].

**Multi-user Che**

Multi-user Che provides multi-tenancy. Che uses http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] as a mechanism to register, manage, and authenticate users. Keycloak tokens provide security for user accounts and workspaces. The Permissions API regulates access to different entities such as workspaces, stacks, recipes, and organizations. User information is stored in a persistent PostgreSQL database which supports migrations.

The advantages for using multi-user Che are:

* The fully functional web IDE supports precise access controls
* The standalone Keycloak server supports users federation and identity providers

By default Che deploys in the single-user mode for Docker and OpenShift. You can use special flags to enable multi-user functionality.

The following links have more information on installation: 

* To install Che in the multi-user mode on Docker, see link:docker-multi-user[Multi-user on Docker].

* To install Che in the multi-user mode on OpenShift, see link:openshift-multi-user[Multi-user on OpenShift].
