== System Requirements

* Minimum 4GB RAM (just for the 3 Che containers and one 2GB workspace)
* 2 CPU
* Ports 8080, 5050 and the (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port)[ephemeral port] range publicly available for inbound connections (`32768-65535`)

[id="known-issues"]
== Known Issues

Currently, when running Che Multi User on Windows, PostgreSQL has issues with file permissions that prevents DB from starting. As a workaround, mount a local storage path that is not a Win file system mount:

`-v /chedata/:/data`

We generally do not recommend running Che multi user on Windows for production use.

[id="run-syntax"]
== Run Syntax

----
docker run -it -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -e CHE_HOST=${EXTERNAL_IP} -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/.che-multiuser:/data eclipse/che start
----

`~/.che-multiuser` is any local path. This is where Che data and configuration will be stored.

`${EXTERNAL_IP}` should be a public IP accessible to all users who will access the Che instance. You may drop `CHE_HOST` env if you are running Che locally and will access it from within the same network. In this case, Che CLI will attempt to auto-detect your server IP. However, auto-detection may produce erroneous results, especially in case of a complex network setup. If you run Che as a cloud server, i.e. accessible for external users we recommend explicitly providing an external IP for `CHE_HOST`.

You *MUST* access multi-user Che using hostname/IP specified in `CHE_HOST` or manually add redirect URIs and Web Origins to link:user-management.html#che-and-keycloak[Keycloak client].

[id="whats-under-the-hood"]
== What’s Under the Hood

With `CHE_MULTIUSER=true` Che CLI is instructed to generate a special Docker Composefile that will be executed to produce config and run:

* Keycloak container with pre-configured realm and clients
* PostgreSQL container that will store Keycloak and Che data
* Che server container with a special build of multi-user Che assembly

[id="deployment-diagram"]
== Deployment Diagram

Multi-user Che on Docker does not differ much from a link:openshift-multi-user.html#deployment-diagram[multi-user deployment on OpenShift] in terms of architecture and communication between services. There are a few differences though:

* containers instead of pods
* volume mounts instead of PVCs
* to need to pre-build Keycloak and Postgres images - configuration is mounted into containers
* port 5050 needs to be publicly available (OpenShift uses route and service)
* Che CLI pre-configures and populates values for envs like CHE_HOST, that is then used in Keycloak configuration files

== What’s Next?

Now that you have a running Che Multi-User instance, let’s link:user-management.html[create a user, setup GitHub oAuth and login].
