= Contributing to the Eclipse Che Documentation

== Understanding Che Documentation ecosystem

* Please read the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of conduct].

* Eclipse Che documentation project follows a forking workflow. To learn more, read https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow[Forking Workflow]. 

* Eclipse Che documentation follows the _IBM Style Guide_. If you do not have a paper copy of the style guide, see the
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/styleguidelines/index.html[developerWorks editorial style guide] on the IBM website. While developerWorks is no longer maintained, it still provides useful reference information.

* To learn more about the tool validating the style, see the https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/[`+vale+` documentation].

* Eclipse Che documentation uses AsciiDoc for markup. To learn more about AsciiDoc syntax, see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writerâ€™s Guide].

* Eclipse Che documentation uses https://docs.antora.org[Antora] to build the documentation.

* The Eclipse Che documentation project follows guidelines from the
https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/[Modular Documentation Initiative]. As Antora is using the term of _module_ with a different meaning, this project is referring to modules as _topics_. To understand the nature of topics, see the https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#modular-docs-terms-definitions[Appendix A: Modular Documentation Terms and Definitions].

* To learn more about the `+newdoc+` tool generating the topic
templates, see https://github.com/mrksu/newdoc[`+newdoc+` documentation].

* To learn more about the `+test-adoc+` tool validating the topic files, see the https://github.com/jhradilek/check-links[`+test-adoc+`documentation].

* To learn more about Hosted Che, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/[Hosted Che documentation].


[id="documentation-workflow"]
== The documentation workflow

.Procedure

. Contributor submits a new code pull request in https://github.com/eclipse/che and adds the `status/doc-impact` label.

. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer ensures that a documentation pull request for the che-docs repository is provided and referenced from the code pull request.

.. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides a complete documentation pull request that can then be merged by the members of the documentation team without further editing.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides at least an initial draft of the content and reaches out to the documentation-team members for assistance with editing, so that the documentation pull request can be finalized.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer reaches out to the members of the documentation team and work with them on submitting a documentation pull request.

. The documentation pull request is reviewed. For more details, see xref:editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content[].

. The code pull request is merged into the che repository.

. The documentation pull request is merged into the che-docs repository.


[id="editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content"]
== Editing, submitting and reviewing new content

.Procedure

. Open a che-docs workspace running on Hosted Che: `++https++://che.openshift.io/factory?url=https://github.com/__<github-handle>__/che-docs/tree/__<branch-name>__/`

. Create a branch `__<branch-name>__` for your work.

. Edit the content.

. Build and validate the new content. See: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. To merge the content, open a pull request. Submit the pull request against the default `+master+` branch. Specify as much information as possible in the pull request template.

. When you intend to review a pull request, click Assignees in the GitHub pull request view. This indicates you are the reviewer and avoids duplication of efforts.

. To review the pull request:

.. Validate the accuracy of content, as well as build, language, links and modular docs requirements.

.. For documentation updates containing testable steps, the documentation pull request needs to have the `team/che-qe` label set and get reviewed by both the documentation team and the Che QA team.

.. For documentation updates not containing testable steps, the documentation pull request needs to get reviewed by the documentation team.

.. For more information, see xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. The continuous integration process is publishing content once merged in the `+master+` publication branch.

.Verification steps

* Navigate to the publication URL of Eclipse Che Documentation: link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/[] and search for your changes.


[id="building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che"]
== Building and validating the documentation using Che

To build the Eclipse Che documentation from a Che workspace, follow the steps below.

.Prerequisites

* Open a Che workspace containing a fork of the documentation. See xref:editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content[].

.Procedure

. Open _My Workspace_.

. To process generated documentation: Open _User Runtimes / bash-curl / Generate reference tables_.

. To build the documentation and start the preview server: open _User Runtimes / che-docs-dev / Start preview server_.

. To validate the language of the files currently open, look at the _Problems_ panel in the _Bottom Panel_. To toggle the view of this panel use the _View > Problems_ menu entry.

. To validate the compliance of an AsciiDoc file with Modular Documentation guidelines:

.. In the _Explorer_, right-click on file to validate and select _Copy Path_.

.. Open _User Runtimes / che-docs-dev / Validate Modular Doc_.

.. In the _Validate Modular Doc_ panel in the _Bottom Panel_, paste the path of the file to validate.

.. The tool `+test-adoc+` tests the file and produces some output.

. To validate all links: open _User Runtimes / linkchecker / Validate links_.


[id="creating-a-new-topic-using-che"]
== Creating a new topic using Che

To create a new topic using a Che workspace:

.Procedure

. Open _My Workspace_.
. Open _User Runtimes / tools / Create a new topic_.
. Choose the target guide among the available guides:
+
* `+overview+`: introductory section
* `+end-user-guide+`: documentation for developers: navigating
dashboard, working in Che-Theia, and so on
* `+installation-guide+`: installation guides
* `+administration-guide+`: documentation for administrators of the
clusters: configuring Che on a cluster, managing users, monitoring
resources, security and data recovery
* `+contributor-guide+`: how to develop plug-ins for Che, add new
debuggers, languages, and so on
* `+extensions+`: documentation about extensions for Che, such as
Eclipse Che4z, OpenShift Connector.

. Choose the topic nature:
+
* `+assembly+`
* `+concept+`
* `+procedure+`
* `+reference+`

. Enter the title for the new topic.

.Verification steps

. The file is generated in the `+src/main/pages-che-7/<guide_name>/+` directory and the script displays related information.


== Adding images

.Procedure

. Add images to one of the subdirectories in the `+src/main/che/docs/images/+` directory. Create a new subdirectory if none of the existing ones fits the new image.

. To publish an image, use the following syntax:
+
....
image::directory/img.png[alt text]
....
+
Images are sized automatically. You can provide a URL to a full-size image, as well as a caption and alt text:
+
....
.Click to view a larger image
[link=che/docs/images/devel/js_flow.png
image::devel/js_flow.png[Alt text]
....

Do not post too many images unless it is absolutely necessary. Animated `+.gif+` images are preferred, especially when explaining how to use complex UI features.

== Using special characters

* To prevent special characters from being interpreted as formatting mark-up, use pass-through macros. 
+
.To escape underscores, asterisks, or backticks, use:
====
....
pass:[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
....
====

== Building and validating Documentation on a local environment

This section describes how to build and validate the documentation on a local environment.

WARNING: This is not the preferred method. For the supported method, see: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

+
----
$ bash ./tools/test-adoc.sh <PATH_TO_THE_FILE>
----

+
----
$ vale <PATH_TO_THE_FILE>"
